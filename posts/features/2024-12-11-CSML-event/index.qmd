The aim of the event was to increase interactions between researchers working on CSML across all departments at UCL. It included a broad range of talks highlighting exciting methodological advances in MCMC, simulation-based inference and robust optimisation, but also applications of CSML methods in genetics, cosmology, and medical imaging. 

Speakers included [Harita Dellaporta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=avnp0ZsAAAAJ&hl=en) (soon-to-be UCL Statistical Science), [Jason McEwen](http://www.jasonmcewen.org/) (UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory), [Ziheng Yang](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/) (UCL Genetics, Evolution and Environment), [Niall Jeffrey](https://nialljeffrey.github.io/) (UCL Physics & Astronomy), [Marta Betcke](https://sites.google.com/site/mbetcke/) (UCL Computer Science), and [Sam Livingstone](https://samueljlivingstone.wixsite.com/webpage) (UCL Statistical Science).
