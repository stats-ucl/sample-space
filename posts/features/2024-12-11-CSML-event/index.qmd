   On Tuesday 5th December, the department co-hosted an event on 'Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) in the Sciences' with around 80 attendees. This took place at the London Mathematical Society, and was co-organised by our departments' [CSML research theme](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/computational-statistics-and-machine-learning), the [UCL Centre for Data Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/data-science/), and the [UCL ELLIS unit](https://ellis.eu/units/london-ucl), with the organisation led by [Dr. François-Xavier Briol](https://fxbriol.github.io/) and [Dr. Kayvan Sadeghi](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucakksa/).

The aim of the event was to increase interactions between researchers working on CSML across all departments at UCL. It included a broad range of talks highlighting exciting methodological advances in MCMC, simulation-based inference and robust optimisation, but also applications of CSML methods in genetics, cosmology, and medical imaging.
