description: "Stephanie Dickinson talks to Domna Ladopoulou, a researcher in the Department of Statistical Science at UCL, is working on improving the efficiency and reliability of wind energy production through statistical and machine learning modelling approaches. Her research focuses on developing a probabilistic condition monitoring system for wind farms using SCADA data to detect faults and failures early. This system aims to enhance the sustainability of wind farms by reducing maintenance costs and improving overall reliability."

Domna's methodology involves non-parametric probabilistic methods like Gaussian processes and probabilistic neural networks, which offer flexibility and computational efficiency. She emphasizes the importance of informed decision-making in sustainability and the potential for her research to be scaled globally, particularly in regions with high wind power reliance.
