   *The Department of Statistical Science will be running a continuation of the previous academic year’s project. This will involve students in our department designing an "Online Open Access Course" about eugenics, from the perspective of Statistical Science and with reference to it.*

Our Head of Department has written a statement in support of this initiative:

"This is an extremely timely proposal to challenge the legacy of eugenics, as there are benefits of a changing societal perspective to give this work credibility and power that previously was not possible to have. 

It is important that these challenges come from our Statistical Science department specifically, because it was here that eugenics was developed originally. In addition, in conversation with colleagues at other UK institutions, it appears that the whole statistical community does not have a full grasp of our discipline’s role in this particular context. The legacy is still intertwined with much of the subject as it is taught today and many aspects of new technology connected to the subject also have added eugenics baggage. Key examples are represented by problems associated with discrimination bias in human data processing, e.g. in "frisk-and-search" policies, or facial/imaging reconstruction.

Student-led activities to bring about changes to the eugenics legacy are the most empowering. In my view, Stephanie’s proposal has certainly the potential to help the students effectively become the teachers and thus learn while they are in fact leading in the process. 

With this continuation project, which is one of the departmental strategic priorities, within our EDI activities, the brief given to students will be to create an Online Open Access Course about eugenics. A facilitator will act as a support, but the content is designed by students. The course will be available long term and will be a lasting change outcome of the ChangeMakers process. 
The course will provide wide outreach. The output will be publicly available, contributing to the wider understanding of the underlying phenomenon.

Gianluca Baio, Professor of Statistics and Health Economics"

If you are a student in the Statistical Science department and you want to get involved, please sign up [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/V668DTK): 

If you are interested but do not want the commitment of regularly attending workshops, please be aware that we will be running a half way feedback event during Term 2 which will be a very social and fun event with cake, where we will invite (anonymous, via Menti) feedback from Statistical Science students and staff about the course development progress.
