# The event
The UCL Data Science and AI Hackathon 2025 was held on 5th November 2025 and was open to 
final year undergraduates and MSc students from the UCL Department of Statistical Science. 
There were 22 participants, divided into 6 teams in total. 


# The challenge

The brief for the challenge was the following: 

  * A climate crisis campaigning organisation called Z Climate Change is revamping their website. 
  * They need an impactful demonstration of climate change based on real data.
  * They like the idea of using statistics and/or machine learning to show the impact. 
  * Your company is bidding for the work to create this website. 
  * Prepare your bid presentation and deliver it. 

The Client (Z Climate Change) has already provided a proof of concept demo using AI, 
which was provided to the Hackathon participants. This was created by asking ChatGPT to:

<!-- shown in https://github.com/james-shepherd/UCL-hackathon-2025. -->

* Use data from the [Open Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/).
* Use an ARIMA model.
* Predict the next year's max temperature.
* Show the data and prediction in a graph.
* Do all of this in HTML and JavaScript.

Your task is to create something better!

# The winners
The teams worked tirelessly throughout the day under the guidance of Prof Cotar and Dr Shepherd, combining their knowledge of data analysis, data visualiation, statistical modelling, machine learning and programming. They also learnt plenty of HTML and JavaScript along the way! 
There were three winning teams, and all winning participants received a fancy raspberry pie full kit for each member of each of the teams:

Winning team: Data4Earth 
Second place: Shamrocks 
Third Place: Climate Cleaners
