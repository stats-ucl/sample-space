description: "The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference is a pivotal meeting that bridges the fields of computer science, biology, and bioinformatics together. It was held from 12th July to 16th July in Montréal, Canada this year. ISMB 2024 featured 17 specialised tracks, encompassing a broad spectrum of topics within computational biology and bioinformatics, including sequence analysis, systems biology, molecular dynamics, computational and systems immunology, digital agriculture, …etc. The conference also offered a variety of workshops, tutorials, and keynote sessions, making it a comprehensive forum that appeals to professionals across the field."

The conference also hosted several social events designed to facilitate networking among participants. Among these, the event titled "Women in Computational Biology" left a particularly strong impression on me. Unlike the more conventional dinner events, this event offered a more relaxed atmosphere, guiding attendees on a tour of Montréal. This setting allowed participants to first become acquainted with one another, naturally transitioning into discussions about their research and work as the event progressed.

I was pleased to have my poster presentation scheduled two days after the "Women in Computational Biology" event. Engaging with individuals I had met during that event provided valuable insights, revealing that the interests of many conference attendees lean more towards biological aspects rather than mathematical or statistical emphasis. Consequently, I adjusted my presentation to emphasise the biological background and implications of my research, while omitting some of the more detailed statistical theories and equations. This approach not only garnered greater attention but also stimulated more in-depth discussions with the audience.

I gained a wealth of knowledge from this conference, ranging from practical tips—such as including a photo on one’s poster when presenting a poster at big conferences, to facilitating interactions with attendees who may not be able to attend the designated presentation session if they could meet you in the hallway of the conference centre—to significant insights into the latest advancements in my research field, which have provided inspiration for future research directions. Overall, the experience was highly enriching, and I am grateful for the departmental funding that enabled me to attend the  ISMB conference this summer.
