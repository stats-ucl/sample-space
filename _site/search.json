David was a good friend of members of the department and a longstanding research collaborator, particularly with regard to work on spatial-temporal modelling and applications in hydrology.\nDavid was arguably the most influential statistician of the second half of the 20th century. He was knighted in 1985 and received very many prestigious academic prizes and awards including the Guy Medal in Gold by the Royal Statistical Society (1973), the Kettering Prize and Gold Medal for Cancer Research (1990), the Copley Medal of the Royal Society (2010) and he was the first ever recipient of the International Prize in Statistics (2017). During his career, he published more than 380 papers and was working right up until his death.\nDavid was also closely associated with the statistical journal Biometrika, the management of which has been based in the department since its inception in 1901. David was the third editor of Biometrika, following Karl and Egon Pearson, and covered the period 1966-1991. On standing down as editor, he became a trustee of the Biometrika Trust, which is responsible for the continuing publication and development of the journal, retaining that position until 2019 and taking the role of chair from 1993 to 2004. His influence on the development of the journal was immense, and both its current standing in statistical circles and the strength of the trust is, in a large part, down to him. We shall miss him."

UCL is proud to be a founding partner in the scheme, and in July 2019, the Department of Statistical Science welcomed five Year 12 students for an inspirational week of learning that statistics is not, in fact, boring!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlacements in the mathematical sciences are a new venture for in2science and we were delighted to be one of the first departments to host students interested in maths.\nThe students, who came from in and around London, spent the week visiting various members of staff. We wanted the students to witness first-hand how diverse statistics as a subject actually is, and in doing so we were hoping to show them that statistics at university is a lot more interesting than what they do in school! They learnt some R with Elinor Jones and were able to use their new-found skills to build models with Tom Fearn.\nOther highlights included learning about forensic statistics with Ardo Van den Hout, trying out some maths with Sam Livingstone, and discussing risk and disaster statistics with Katerina Stavrianaki. They even had a morning discussing statistics and crop genetics with Michael Scott – a researcher from the Division of Biosciences at UCL – who gave them a primer on genetics before showing how statistics is used in crop research.\nFor some of the students, the highlight was spending a morning at the Turing Institute with Franz Kiraly. The Turing Institute, which is housed at the British Library on Euston Road, is a very inspiring space. There they spent the morning discussing data science, and the students certainly returned to the Department of Statistical Science with even more enthusiasm for learning statistics.\nWe certainly changed the students’ minds about statistics by the end of the week – they all agreed that statistics was far more interesting than they ever thought possible. Intriguingly, they commented that statistics as a subject was completely different to what they perceived it to be. It’s encouraging that most of the students ended the week keen to study at least some statistics at university.\nWe’re looking forward to showing more school students just how great studying statistics can be, and why it’s so important to be statistically literate."

We’re now accustomed to the daily reports of new positive COVID-19 tests, and we’ve become adept at analysing the graphs showing these stats, often normalised per 100,000 of population to allow for comparison across countries and regions.\nNumber of new positive COVID-19 tests in the UK, from 2nd March 2020 to 5th January 2022, as illustrated following a Google search of ‘COVID UK’.\nIn July 2020, the then US President Donald Trump observed: “if we did half the testing, we would have half the cases.” He’s not wrong: the number of identified cases is highly dependent on the number of tests taken. A country rife with COVID-19 but with zero testing capacity might, according to this metric, appear to be having a wonderful pandemic."

    "section": "Why it matters who we test",
    "text": "Why it matters who we test\nA related – but more subtle – point surrounds the question of who gets tested. Most countries have implemented targeted testing schemes, focusing their limited testing capacity on specific groups of people. For example, in England, individuals are asked to take a PCR test if they have particular symptoms (high temperature, continuous cough, or loss of taste or smell). Similarly, healthcare professionals have to get regular tests in order to protect the people they’re caring for.\nThese targeted groups are more likely than the overall population to test positive for COVID-19, either because they have symptoms, or because they work in care homes, hospitals etc and are at a higher risk of catching the virus. This means that the number of positive test counts isn’t necessarily an accurate reflection of the true prevalence of the virus: the proportion of the entire population infected at any particular point in time is typically less than the proportion we would infer directly from the targeted test data.\nThis difference can be quite extreme, with the proportion of targeted tests returning a positive result (the ‘positivity rate’) often exceeding the underlying prevalence proportion by an order of magnitude (Figure 2, top row). Despite this, targeted test data is commonly used to estimate prevalence and the now-familiar effective reproduction number, Rt (the average number of people that an infected person will go on to infect)."

    "section": "The benefits of randomised surveillance",
    "text": "The benefits of randomised surveillance\nIn England, we are very fortunate to have not one but two national, randomised surveillance studies that measure the level of coronavirus infection in the community: the COVID-19 Infection Survey (carried out by the Office for National Statistics) and the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study (Imperial College London). The randomised nature of these studies ensures that they provide representative estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence across the entire population, not just among symptomatics or frontline workers.\nRunning these studies is expensive, however, and most of the tests will be negative by definition if the overall population prevalence is just a few percent. So, the number of positive tests returned is relatively small in comparison to the targeted testing schemes. As a result, randomised studies provide prevalence estimates that, while accurately targeting the true prevalence on average, may be highly variable when considering smaller areas.\nThat said, such fine-scale, localised estimates are incredibly useful for policy makers when they need to prepare resources for healthcare systems or design interventions to control the spread of disease, such as increases in testing capacity or social restrictions."

    "section": "Our quest for accurate and fine-scale prevalence estimates",
    "text": "Our quest for accurate and fine-scale prevalence estimates\nIn our work, recently published in Nature Microbiology, we sought to combine the targeted test counts with data from randomised surveillance studies, to provide debiased, local, weekly estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. We did so through a causal statistical framework that estimates the probability of an infected person being tested versus a non-infected person being tested, and then transforms targeted test counts appropriately to generate debiased estimates of the true underlying local prevalence.\nInference for this model consisted of four steps. First, we inferred weekly prevalence at a coarse geographic level from the randomised testing data. Second, we combined this prevalence with the targeted testing data to get an estimate of the probability of an infected person being tested, again at the coarser spatial scale. Third, we smoothed these estimates longitudinally, working under the assumption that the probability an infected person gets tested only varies a little from week to week. Finally, we used these smoothed estimates to infer local (finer geographical scale) prevalence from the targeted test counts.\nFigure 2 shows our statistical framework in action. The top row of panels shows the uncorrected test positivity rate against REACT prevalence estimates for the 311 local authorities in England, illustrating how test positivity was upwardly biased. The bottom row of panels shows how our prevalence estimates are unbiased relative to the REACT estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop row: uncorrected COVID-19 test positivity rate vs. REACT prevalence estimates for the 311 local authorities in England. Bottom row: debiased prevalence estimates vs. REACT prevalence estimates. The error bars associated with our estimates are much smaller than the REACT error bars, pointing to the increase in precision we get by including the targeted test data.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also use our framework to estimate the effective reproduction number Rt in different local authorities. We do this by fitting an epidemic model to the debiased data, which allows us to track the state of individuals from ‘susceptible’ to ‘infected’ to ‘recovered’ (known as an SIR model). We found that local estimates of Rt were indicative of one- to two-week-ahead changes in the number of positive tests, and that increases in estimated local prevalence and Rt reflected the spread of both the Alpha and Delta variants of the virus. Figure 3 uses our data to show the spread of the Alpha variant in December 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial distribution of debiased SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (maps on left), Rt (maps in centre) and the Alpha variant frequency (maps on right, measured by % S-gene target failure, SGTF) for the two weeks of 6 and 20 December 2020 (top and bottom respectively). The increased transmissibility of the Alpha variant is further illustrated in the scatter plots on the right, which plot Rt against the Alpha variant frequency (% SGTF) for each ‘lower-tier local authority’ (LTLA). We report results for 311 LTLAs in England, split into nine regions.\n\n\n\n\nOur work demonstrates how randomised surveys such as REACT can complement targeted testing to improve statistical accuracy in monitoring the spread of COVID-19. We believe that the international response to the current pandemic, as well as preparedness for future ones, can benefit from surveillance schemes that combine random sampling with targeted testing in this way. Used together, these techniques will provide a powerful way of keeping track of emerging and ongoing infectious diseases."

I suggested that we do something to change this situation, in keeping with other similar actions globally where many are engaging with decolonisation. It was agreed that a sign could be put up to explain and educate, to remove the unintended complicity. I sent out a call for contributions: Dr Simon Harden took the text originally written by Professor Tom Fearn (who was part of the Eugenics Inquiry) and condensed it, Professor Gianluca Baio (our Head of Department) made some final adjustments and I sent it to a sign maker to get manufactured and installed.

The room is a well-kept secret from the students of UCL, being hidden in plain sight behind an unmarked door in the North Cloisters. The purpose of our visit today is to recreate a famous statistical experiment, with a few twists.\nThe brains behind the test, associate professor Dr Terry Soo, sits confidently to my right. To my left, looking rather less confident, is research fellow Dr Nathan Green. Terry’s ingenious plan is to recreate the famous lady tasting tea experiment, devised by Sir Ronald Fisher around 100 years ago to assess whether his colleague at Rothamsted Research, Muriel Bristol, was able to correctly identify, as she proclaimed, whether milk or tea was poured first into the cup.\nOur premise is slightly different, owing to Dr Soo’s preference for whiskey over tea. I was intrigued when he initially proposed the idea, as the addition of alcohol seemed to give a new twist to an old story. The initial design, however, required Dr Soo to drink eight glasses of whiskey in a single sitting. This seemed a little extreme! To make the experiment more palatable, Dr Green offered his assistance, and I must admit that this intrigued me further, as more statistical questions could now be asked of the data."

In four of these the milk was poured first, followed by the tea, and in the remaining four the reverse was done. Fisher provided a 10-page analysis of the result in his 1935 book ‘The Design of Experiments’. Under the null hypothesis that Ms Bristol’s classification was independent of the truth, the number of cups that she should have correctly been able to classify would follow a hypergeometric distribution (a result that later formed the basis of Fisher’s Exact Test). Using this knowledge, Fisher computed a significance level that he deemed suitable to draw the conclusion that this hypothesis could be safely rejected. Unfortunately for his colleague, this resulted in his requirement that all eight cups must be classified correctly for him to believe her claim. Our present day variation involves two participants, who will each consume four half-glasses of whiskey. I consult with the bar staff on the most similar tasting choices, before deciding on Bell’s and Johnnie Walker (black). The former represents a cheaper option and so provides an alternative classification system. This is helpful, as Dr Green has no idea how either brand should taste."

    "text": "Whiskey-o-clock\nAfter carefully arranging the glasses and looking pretty suspicious as I bring them over to the table on a large tray, I place them before the participants and hand them options one by one. Dr Soo begins smelling alternatives, before drinking the first and confidently declaring it to be Johnnie Walker. He then proceeds through the remaining three glasses without much trouble. In the last case, he correctly classifies the drink from smell alone. I worry that perhaps the experiment is too easy.\nMy fears are allayed, however, when it comes to the turn of Dr Green. The first glass is not too bad for him, but upon drinking the second he lets out a loud groan. “That was worse than the first one,” he says, before declaring that it must be Bell’s, the cheaper option. He is, in fact, correct, but then proceeds to drink the remaining two with a louder groan on each occasion. People are starting to stare. He decides that they must all be Bell’s. This leads to a classification of three Bell’s and one Johnnie Walker in his case, despite the fact that he has been told a priori that there will be two of each.\nQuestions and (some) answers\nIs it fair to treat each tasting test as independent, given that in the latter case he has already consumed a significant amount of whiskey in a short period of time? Is it fair to pool the observations recorded by a seasoned whisky pro with those of a comparative novice and treat them as exchangeable? I ignore these questions in my quest for a pragmatic answer to our initial question. My participants were able to correctly classify seven out of eight. Not bad, but not good enough for Fisher. Ms Bristol, by contrast, did in fact correctly classify all eight cups of tea.\nDr Soo is frustrated, and he has a right to be. In fact, I was not completely sure whether I had correctly remembered the brand of Dr Green’s last shot, and so I had asked Dr Soo to smell it beforehand, after which he confidently whispered to me that it was Johnnie Walker (as I had suspected). Such confidence hinted that perhaps Dr Soo could have done it all on his own. Alas, this was not the experiment.\nTreating the subjects separately, we have 4/4 correctly classified for Dr Soo versus 3/4 for Dr Green. Neither of these cases, however, achieve the level of significance required by Fisher to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in taste between the whiskies. The sample size is simply not large enough.\nDr Soo is eager for more, but I call things to a close, and suggest that we wash away the taste with some Housman ale instead. “Perhaps we will try again in the next edition,” I cheekily suggest, to which Dr Green responds with the loudest groan of the night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Housman room – hidden in plain sight behind an unmarked door in North Cloisters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Green (left) and Dr Soo (right) are eager to begin the tasting."

It’s also a vast and evolving discipline, and with more research staff interacting with other UCL departments and visiting scholars, the IMSS will allow us to cover most of its research areas.\nWe’ve seen the power of joint research across many of our other departments, and bringing great minds together will lead to fundamental breakthroughs across disciplines. The IMSS wants to create an atmosphere of lively research collaboration between mathematical sciences and other departments across UCL.\nWith a concentration of around 135 academic and teaching staff, from early career professionals to established world-leading researchers, the IMSS will support a thriving community of students who will get to experience cross-disciplinary interaction everyday. We will recruit and nurture outstanding mathematicians and statisticians, and provide an environment in which they can flourish and contribute to wider society. Beyond UCL, the IMSS will fully exploit its central London location by strengthening interactions with institutions like the Alan Turing Institute, the Francis Crick Institute, GCHQ, London’s financial industry and government departments. It will also be internationally accessible, with facilities and a forward-thinking events programme to bring our research to the wider world. We aim to host national and international meetings, conferences and workshops in the mathematical sciences, with involvement from learned societies in our disciplines."

I predicted the number of incoming migrants for each EU state in 2017, based on historical socio-economic, education, healthcare and welfare data that I gathered and sorted from the UN, Eurostat and OECD Statistics. The workload was definitely more than what I was used to at UCL, since weekly assignments and midterms grades were emphasised alongside the final exam. I definitely recommend taking project-based classes for students who are looking to travel around.\nOutside of academics, I travelled to cities along the West and East Coasts of the US, plus Toronto, Montréal and Cancun. Although I was only there for two terms, I was fortunate enough to be able to pledge a fraternity and compete nationally with the rugby squad. For those in the first and second year, studying abroad as part of the MSci International Programme is something I’d definitely recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nHannah Summers\nSnow. Squirrels. Study. The three pillars to my eight-month venture into the world of University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.\nWith six months below zero degrees celsius, and Christmas spent on the Great Lakes, the experience was unlike any I have had before. Days were spent watching the squirrels (both brown and black) through my window whilst I studied, exploring the local craft beers and visiting nearby lakes.\nI studied a wide variety of topics from function estimation, to group theory, to classification, to the epistemology of ignorance. And I undertook national data science competitions whilst investigating the connection between the herb valerian and insomnia. I had the opportunity to experience refreshingly different styles of teaching and explore new areas of learning, in particular a fascinating look at the world of data visualisation.\nWaterloo was the perfect balance of the known (the language, studying, coffee) and the unknown (the people, food and the arrival of the geese). The year was a beautiful adventure filled with many a FaceTime chat, the best burgers, and perfect crisp blue mornings.

    "text": "Professor Serge Guillas is leading a team seeking better ways to predict potentially disastrous tsunamis using high-performance computing… \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently, major tsunamis in Indonesia and Japan have caused the insurance industry and civil authorities around the world to demand better models to assess tsunami risk. In particular, the economic impacts of the tsunamis include losses of livelihoods and incomes, loss of boats and gear among fishing communities, and increased levels of poverty in the aftermath of the event.\nTo model tsunami waves and currents, and their uncertainties, UCL’s research group of PhD students, postdocs, and research software engineers is making use of high-performance computing (HPC).\nProf Guillas is leading several projects to improve both long-term risk assessments and short-term warnings using HPC and modern statistical methods:\nUQM3: ‘Uncertainty Quantification Of Multi-scale And Multi-physics Computer Models: Applications To Hazard And Climate’ in collaboration with the Universities of Oxford, Warwick and Exeter. Running from 01/10/2018 – 30/09/2020.\nThis project aims to answer some of the questions around natural events, such as tsunamis, earthquakes or climate changes, by quantifying the uncertainties in complex simulators.\nUncertainty Quantification uses surrogate models that allow the uncertainties to be modelled more efficiently. However, designing a workflow that integrates models as diverse as natural phenomena is a challenge.\nWhen applied to natural events, it’s hoped that Uncertainty Quantification will help us carry out risk assessments around the impact of earthquakes or tsunamis, for example. This will help us understand how to build resilient infrastructure and protect populations.\nUQM3’s research is carried out at the Alan Turing Institute - the national institute for data science and artificial intelligence - with headquarters at the British Library. It’s part of the Data-centric Engineering (DCE) programme of the Turing.\nRADDISH: ‘Real-Time Advanced Data Assimilation for Digital Simulation of Numerical Twins on HPC’, funded by the Strategic Priorities Fund, EPSRC AI for Science and Government. Running from 01/08/2019 – 31/07/2020.\nBased at the Turing Institute, RADDISH is implementing agent-based models to facilitate tsunami warnings and evacuation modelling.\nUsing high performance computers, a digital twin of a tsunami event can track actions in real-time using live data. We can accurately monitor how an event would unfold and identify areas where changes can be made to procedure to improve the safety of those involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVETII: ‘Vessels Evacuation from Tsunamis in India and Indonesia’, funded by the Grand Challenge Research Fund (GCRF). Running from 01/01/2020 – 30/06/2020.\nVETII uses accurate agent-based models of vessels in ports around India and Indonesia and applies probabilistic tsunami current hazard assessments to simulated models.\nWe can apply different scenarios to these models to see how quickly people can evacuate when a tsunami occurs, ultimately creating the most efficient layout for boats in different ports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFITTER: ‘Future Indonesian Tsunamis: Towards End-to-end Risk Quantification’ funded by the Lloyd’s Tercentenary Research Foundation, the Lighthill Risk Network and the Lloyd’s Register Foundation. Running from 2019 – 2022.\nFITTER will focus on the risk of a tsunami hitting areas of important infrastructure. We will produce stochastic tsunami hazard footprints, new vulnerability functions for the resilience of infrastructure such as ports, and for the livelihood of populations. This open model will be of use to both Government and the insurance industry, and enable modern disaster risk financing for Indonesia.\n‘Uncertainty Quantification for Tsunamis’ on the Cambridge Service for Data Driven Discovery (CSD3) facility, EPSRC tier 2 HPC. Running from 01/10/2018 – 30/09/2022.\nIn this project, we’re assessing tsunami simulations on the UK’s largest graphical processing unit (GPU) cluster. This means we can use Uncertainty Quantification to predict the complex nature of tsunamis with more accuracy and detail.\nEarly warnings using satellites Running from 2019 – 2023.\nIn collaboration with the University of Shizuoka (Japan), and with UCL PhD student Ryuichi Kanai funded by the Japan Student Services Organization, we aim to collect signals within minutes of the tsunami from the ionosphere through GPS satellites.\nAGITHAR Prof Guillas is also UK representative and Chair of the Working group on Uncertainties, in the COST action ‘Accelerating Global Science in Tsunami Hazard and Risk Analysis’ (2019-2023, 25 countries). This network will improve, standardise, and promote tsunami research.\nYou can find the latest developments in Professor Guillas’ research by visiting: https://www.turing.ac.uk.\n\nImpact on populations: Prof Guillas visited the region of Mumbai, India, in 2018 and 2019, to engage with the fishermen community. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has been facilitating our disaster resilience project in the region."

After a while this wasn’t practical, so I decided to move back home.\nHow much did your university experience change during lockdown versus before the pandemic?\nMy experience changed quite dramatically as the social aspect of university was much more difficult; not simply the nightlife but discussions in lectures were less enjoyable over Zoom due to the lack of interactions and the blank screens.\nWere there any aspects of lockdown studying that you found particularly challenging?\nDue to the nature of Zoom I attended lectures from my bedroom, however I found it became quite mundane to work in my room and then sleep in the same room day after day. I eventually decided to change the location I worked from to create a bit of variety.\nWere there any aspects that you preferred to in-person studying?\nFor some modules, it used to be policy not to record the lectures (pre-COVID). Being able to refer to lecture recordings and detailed explanations on specific aspects of the course is much more useful.\nDid you manage to stay connected with friends from your course, or even make new ones?\nI managed to stay in contact with friends I made in my first year, however making new friends over Zoom wasn’t plausible, and thus it was more difficult to get the same level of interaction in my second year.\nWhat kind of university experience (fully in-person or a blend of in-person and remote) do you hope for going forward, either for yourself or those beginning a degree in the future?\nI would hope, going forward, that everything returns to fully in-person teaching, but with the lectures recorded. This would not only make the social aspect of university life better but would also allow you to know your professors beyond a compulsory weekly lecture.\n\n\nRishika George\nBSc Economics and Statistics (3rd year)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere were you studying during the lockdown/remote working period?\nDuring the lockdown I was studying in Dubai. That is why, for me, quiet mornings with lessons in the evening (due to the time zone) became the slow ebb and flow of my daily routine.\nHow much did your university experience change during lockdown versus before the pandemic?\nThe year 2020 brought a lot of unexpected changes – the most prominent for students being the switch from whiteboards to laptop screens. The idea of remote learning did not seem daunting given the nature of a statistical science course and the familiarity of Lecturecast. While there were no frantic mornings trying (and miserably failing) to find the hidden entrance to the Darwin Building, the sudden isolation and monotony was strange. I did find it easy to adapt to an all-online setting, and with most lectures being asynchronous, I was able to adjust my schedule to better suit my learning style. However, the benefits could not replace the relaxed conversations with the lecturers while waiting for other students to arrive, or those special treats some give out before the Christmas break.\nWere there any aspects of lockdown studying that you found particularly challenging?\nI would say building and maintaining a rapport with the lecturers was a lot more difficult with online learning.\nWere there any aspects that you preferred to in-person studying?\nIt has almost become second nature to search for the playback speed option on videos to slow down the more challenging bits and save time on familiar concepts. It did help to be able to pause and take down notes for each module as well. Also, office hours were a lot easier to attend in between lectures and tutorials since I did not need to rush to different locations.\nDid you manage to stay connected with friends from your course, or even make new ones?\nI definitely stayed in touch with the friends I made in my first year. It wasn’t too easy making new friends on the course, but I did meet new people through the UCL Statistics Society which was exciting!\nWhat kind of university experience (fully in-person or a blend of in-person and remote) do you hope for going forward, either for yourself or those beginning a degree in the future?\nHaving joined in 2019, I was able to experience three contrasting teaching styles, in-person, online and a hybrid setting, each one appealing in its own way. I’m sure every student would have their view on what worked best. I would say online learning was certainly ‘comfortable’ but seeing the portico before class every morning is a charm in itself! That is why, even with the convenience of asynchronous learning and Zoom lectures, I would still prefer the in-person experience any day.\n\n\nLuke Hardcastle\nMSc Medical Statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere were you studying during the lockdown/remote working period?\nI moved back in with family when the pandemic started and then moved to London for the second half of the year. I was lucky in both cases to be able to fit a desk in, and have access to a quiet working space.\nHow much did your university experience change during lockdown versus before the pandemic?\nIt was a slightly surreal experience starting a degree during lockdown – rather than getting to explore a new place and meet new people I spent my time logging into Zoom and Moodle.\nWere there any aspects of lockdown studying that you found particularly challenging?\nI missed the small conversations with other students or lecturers after a lecture, which help clarify ideas and topics I hadn’t fully understood.\nWere there any aspects that you preferred to in-person studying?\nI can’t say I ever minded being able to roll out of bed five minutes before a 9am lecture, or having my cat with me while I studied! Being able to work through online materials at your own pace when you wanted to was also very useful.\nDid you manage to stay connected with friends from your course, or even make new ones?\nI managed to meet a few new people through group assignments, and there was a useful discord server that was set up at the start of the year for people studying Statistics or Computer Science to chat through. I was lucky, however, to already have a strong support network from previous studies and work.\nWhat kind of university experience (fully in-person or a blend of in-person and remote) do you hope for going forward, either for yourself or those beginning a degree in the future?\nHopefully lectures and tutorials will revert to being in-person, but I also hope that the advances in accessibility and availability of materials brought on by the pandemic will remain!"

    "text": "Statistical distances are mathematical objects which allow us to calculate the distances not between Euclidean measurements, but directly between probability distributions. They are used in a wide variety of ways including the design of statistical estimators, to create approximations of probability distributions, or even to measure the convergence of a sequence of random variables. They are also widely used as theoretical tools to bound the approximation of distributions of interest, or demonstrate convergence.\nThese are all key technical challenges for the implementation of safe and robust statistical and machine learning methods in practice. For example, recent work from our department (and specifically Dr. François-Xavier Briol and Dr Jeremias Knoblauch) showed how statistical distance can be used to design robust and scalable Bayesian inference methods for complicated scientific simulators. Through the choice of an appropriate statistical distance, their method was able to cope much better with the presence of a small number of outliers in the data compared with existing methods. This work attracted a lot of interest from the research community and, in 2022, received the Best Paper Award at the International Conference in Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, one of the leading publication venues at the intersection of statistics and machine learning.\nHowever, this is just one of many areas where statistical distances can have a significant impact. The workshop therefore brought together a broad range of speakers including mathematicians, probabilists, statisticians, and machine learners to discuss a number of key open questions, including:\nThe workshop was organised by Dr. François-Xavier Briol and the superb team of PhD students: Masha Naslidnyk, Oscar Key, Matias Altamirano and Ilina Yozova.

The other was a dataset on the World Happiness Index which related “happiness index” with various characteristics of each country such as GDP, life expectancy and corruption.\nTo enable the students to carry out meaningful data exploration, we taught them the basics of using the R language with RStudio Cloud, with no prior experience assumed.\nEach day was structured with a mix of virtual lessons/demonstrations, group work and information sessions. The students were split into teams of four or five to apply their newly acquired skills by working collaboratively, ultimately producing a presentation at the end of the week. Each team was supported throughout by enthusiastic and dedicated current UCL undergraduate student ambassadors from whom they could seek advice."

They developed their skills in how to explore data, how to dig down into the data by summarising, rearranging, tabulating and plotting, and how to communicate what they found.\nOn the final day, the teams gave presentations to the rest of the group and then voted on their favourite. Prizes of £100 book vouchers (hopefully to be spent on data analysis books!) were awarded for the best presentations. Clear progress had been made and the quality of the final presentations was excellent.\nData Detectives was led by Alex Watson and developed and delivered by Alex, Elinor Jones, Sam Livingstone, Nathan Green and Ioanna Manolopoulou.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNathan Green\n\nNathan is a Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Statistical Science at UCL\nhttps://n8thangreen.github.io/"

It was the first university department of Statistics in the world — you can read about our early history here.\nToday, the department hosts around 50 academic and lecturing staff, over 10 research staff, around 50 PhD students and is supported by over 10 professional staff members. We are a vibrant community, operating at the centre of the academic environment, due to our large network of scientific collaborations, within UCL and with external partners, both in academia and various industry.\nWe work in a wide range of methodologies and applications, as well as in pedagogical activity. We organise a series of weekly seminars, which, whenever possible, are also available remotely and through our own YouTube Channel. We also run a podcast (Random Talks).

    "text": "Subjective science\nFirst emerging as a named discipline in the 19th century, eugenics is the study of how to arrange reproduction among a human population in such a way that characteristics or traits that are deemed to be desirable are spread, whereas those that are not deemed desirable are reduced. The goal, put simply, was to create a superior race through selective breeding. Eugenics gained much traction towards the end of the 19th century among many leading thinkers, and continued to grow in popularity during the early 20th century.\nOne fundamental issue with the idea was that the notion of ‘desirability’ is inherently subjective, and it is therefore easy for those with a particular agenda or prejudices to label certain subsets of a population as ‘not desirable’. Such prejudices were clearly displayed in the Second World War, during which eugenics ideas were enthusiastically adopted by the Nazis. Largely as a result of this, after 1945 the discipline was quietly phased out of mainstream scholarly thought.\nUnfortunately, the history of statistics as a discipline is closely linked to the study of eugenics. The term ‘eugenics’ was coined by Francis Galton, who had close links to UCL. Galton, alongside Karl Pearson, sought to put his flawed ideas on a firm scientific basis, a pursuit which resulted in several methodological advances which, although developed to support unethical research, still form a key part of statistical practice to this day.\nThe history of the Department of Statistical Science at UCL is intrinsically linked to Galton’s legacy. While Galton never held a formal academic post here, upon his death in 1911 he left his fortune to UCL. This was to fund the Galton professorship of eugenics – a role that was filled by Karl Pearson and led directly to the founding of the Department of Applied Statistics."

In January 2021, UCL formally apologised for its role in the development, propagation, and legitimisation of eugenics. This apology has been accompanied by action in removing the names of Galton and Pearson from buildings, lecture rooms and prizes, as well as supporting further research into improving equality and diversity.\nThese changes are already being implemented in the Department of Statistical Science. The previously named Galton Lecture Theatre is now simply room 115, and a notice is on display outside the room explaining why this has happened.

Bayesian ML methods, if duly adjusted to the causal setting, provide useful and flexible tools for counterfactual prediction and uncertainty quantification around the impact of an action on an outcome of interest, given a certain (high-dimensional) context/covariate space.\nOur contributions so far have extended some popular models in the field. Our first work extends the popular Bayesian causal forests learner, to induce more shrinkage/regularisation (hence the name Shrinkage Bayesian Causal Forests) to make it adapt better to sparse data generating processes and discover the main drivers behind the heterogeneity in the response e.g. to a certain treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur second work develops a multi-output deep kernel learning model to deal with causal settings where both context and action space are large, and where one is interested in the impact on multiple correlated outcomes. Current work focuses instead on importance sampling techniques and mediation analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMariya Mamajiwala\nSupervisor: Serge Guillas\nMy research interests lie at the intersection of Monte Carlo methods, differential geometry and stochastics. The aim is to use concepts from differential geometry to develop efficient Monte Carlo algorithms.\nOne of the algorithms I have developed using Langevin dynamics on Riemannian manifolds is for the optimisation of non-convex problems. There are two important aspects to this method. The first is to write a given Ito stochastic differential equation on a Riemannian manifold which may be looked upon as the generalisation of the famous Laplace-Beltrami operator. The second is to define the Riemannian manifold on which to constrain the Langevin diffusion; towards this we have shown how to derive inspiration from some aspects of energetics to define a Riemannian metric which thus defines the manifold. Based on these two aspects we propose the differential geometric counterpart of a Euclidean optimisation method based on Langevin dynamics. The comparison between the Euclidean and geometric approaches is shown in the figure for a 40-dimensional Ackley function (true solution is the 40-dimensional zero vector).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA similar approach is also used to develop algorithms in Markov chain Monte Carlo, machine learning and Bayesian calibration. Moreover, this has also been applied to parameter estimation within the framework of a combined state and parameter estimation problem considered in data assimilation wherein – unlike the other problems mentioned earlier – data is available as a time history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXitong Liang\nSupervisors: Jim Griffin and Samuel Livingstone\nIn the modern high-dimensional setting, a variable selection method for a particular statistical model can not only help make better predictions but can also be used to investigate underlying low-dimensional structure based on the belief that only a small subset of predictors play a crucial role in influencing the response.\nA variable selection method is an automatic procedure that selects the best subset of regressors that explains most of the variation in the response among a massive number of regressors. Bayesian variable selection methods using spike-and-slab priors can be used to extract natural measures of uncertainty such as posterior model probabilities and marginal posterior variable inclusion probabilities. It has been shown that spike-and-slab priors often lead to posterior consistency in the sense that the posterior distribution puts more and more mass around the true model as more observations are gathered.\nThe exact posterior distribution when using a Bayesian spike-and-slab prior is challenging to compute. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are typically used to estimate posterior summaries of interest when the number of regressors is larger than 30.\nMy primary PhD research objective is developing efficient MCMC algorithms targeting discrete-valued high-dimensional distributions, such as posterior distributions in Bayesian variable selection problems.\nWe introduce a new framework, Random Neighbourhood Samplers, and show that many recently introduced algorithms can be viewed as particular cases within the framework. We also describe a novel algorithm, the Adaptive Random Neighbourhood Informed sampler, by combining ideas from some of these existing approaches and show, using several examples of both real and simulated datasets, that a computationally efficient point-wise implementation leads to reliable inferences on a range of variable selection problems, particularly in the very large \\(p\\) setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaiyu Li\nSupervisor: Serge Guillas\nI am interested in uncertainty quantification and machine learning, with a particular focus on Gaussian processes and their application to tsunamis in Indonesia.\nThe simulation of a future Indonesian tsunami will be implemented by using a partial differential equation solver called VOLNA. It is a tsunami simulator that simulates the life cycle of tsunami waves. For the purpose of uncertainty quantification, many tsunami scenarios need to be generated by running tsunami simulators on high performance computing facilities. However, due to the high computational cost of tsunami simulators, it is impractical to do this. Gaussian processes are widely used as surrogate models for spatio-temporal data emulation and prediction, and their properties make them suitable for emulating these kinds of expensive tsunami models. The idea is that we approximate the key features of the expensive computer model using the cheaper Gaussian process surrogate, allowing us to test various scenarios more quickly without having to run the full model as many times as we would otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI want to design novel learning algorithms to improve the efficiency of emulation, prediction and uncertainty propagation, from the aspects of computational linear algebra methods and multi-fidelity modelling. By using computational linear algebraic methods, Gram matrices of Gaussian processes can have a specific structure, e.g. low rank or sparse. The cubic computational cost of using a Gaussian process can also be reduced. The use of multi-fidelity models will also reduce the time cost of data simulation. These algorithms can be applied for assessing the risk of future tsunamis in Indonesia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZhuo Sun\nSupervisor: François-Xavier Briol\nI am working on transfer learning in computational statistics and machine learning. In particular, I have been working on control variates, a post-processing tool to reduce the variance of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimators.\nIntegrals appear in many fields of statistics and machine learning. For instance, the expectation of some integrand against some target distribution is often of interest in statistics – posterior means of parameters, model evidence and other quantities of interest can all be written as integrals. The most common tools for these expectations are MCMC estimators. Control variates are constructed on the basis of Stein operators and the Stein class of the distribution of interest, which only includes functions with zero-mean. By subtracting the control variates from the integrand and taking the average, we get control variates estimators for those integrals, which are known to have much lower variance than that of standard MCMC estimators.\nA recent work of mine is called Vector-valued Control Variates, which generalises the idea of control variates from scalar-valued to vector-valued integrals. We achieve this by proposing novel matrix-valued Stein reproducing kernels. Estimating multiple related integrals jointly can be beneficial as we would expect the information to be shared among these integration tasks. Our experiments also show that vector-valued control variates outperform scalar-valued control variates in many scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay on top of the latest news and research coming from the Department of Statistical Science by visiting: www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics."

    "text": "Mete Veyisoglu spent a year studying MSc Data Science at UCL in 2018/19\nWhen I decided to apply for UCL’s MSc in Data Science, I had been working at Koc University (Istanbul, Turkey) as institutional planning manager for five years. My duties comprised various data-related tasks such as forecasting, financial planning and data-driven decision-making to shape future strategy. I had huge amounts of academic data at my disposal, and I had to be both creative in coming up with various statistics to depict the institution’s outlook and also very careful not to make any scientific errors as it would lead to incorrect decisions.\nIn short, I needed more expertise in the fields of statistics and machine learning. I chose UCL for its strong tradition in statistics (this was a pioneering statistics department, where many of the founders of the discipline worked), its historic Bloomsbury location that is very central but also pleasantly remote from the busy tourist and commuter crowds, and its general reputation as one of the best universities in the world.\nI had to decide between two programmes, MSc in Data Science offered by the Statistics department and MSc in Data Science and Machine Learning offered by the Computer Science department. I chose the first one mainly because I am more oriented towards mathematics and statistics, and I wanted to learn about the classical fundamentals. As the probabilist and risk guru Nassim Nicholas Taleb says in his bestseller ‘Skin In The Game’: “No statistics without logic, no mathematics without proof, no facts without rigor”. Today, the amount of data available in any domain is huge and it is very easy to mistake noise for signal and find interesting but misleading patterns in data. I was hoping to gain the skills to identify these pitfalls.\nReality usually falls short of meeting our expectations, but my year in the Statistics department was an exception to this rule. Not only did I see that all my reasons for choosing UCL and the Data Science programme proved to be correct, but I also found that my classmates were brilliant people. I learned as much from them as I did from the classes.\nOne huge advantage of the programme is that it’s cross-disciplinary, so we had colleagues from a variety of backgrounds such as mathematics, physics, economics and engineering. This made the postgraduate study room a great place to learn from each other. Also, UCL and the Statistics department are doing a great job of listening to students. Faculty members, MSc tutors and administrative management genuinely work towards finding solutions to student-reported issues. This determination to resolve issues, in turn, increased my motivation to learn.\nIn the fall and spring terms, I took very interesting modules including Introduction to Machine Learning, Introduction to Statistical Data Science, Financial Data and Statistics, Extreme Value Theory, and Copula Theory, among others. I loved the system in the UK where you take all the year’s exams in May, so you are not ‘done’ with the fall semester modules in December. This is a good way to ensure that students learn for life, not just for school.\nThe summer term was dedicated to the research project, and it was both challenging and fun. I chose to work on an issue related to my job at Koc University: using statistical and machine learning methods to predict which college students are more likely to fail and eventually drop out of college. I think I worked harder in summer than in either of the other terms – it’s really challenging to deliver a UCL-level MSc dissertation in three months! Nevertheless, I loved the challenge of working on a longer-term project, making small steps of progress every day. I had weekly meetings with my supervisor, Dr. Thomas Honnor, who was very supportive and helped me keep my stamina and my motivation up through summer. In the end, we both were very content with the resulting work. The models that I developed will have huge practical value for Koc University, and the thesis could even serve as a model on how to use data science to increase data-driven policy-making in Turkish Higher Education.\nThe quantitative skills I gained and the brilliant people I met during my year at UCL indicate that this was not a chapter you close and move on from; but one that will always guide you through your career. I am certain that my classmates feel the same.\nLook out for more student stories in future editions of Sample Space."

    "text": "Projects currently being undertaken by the department’s PhD students…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWenyu Wang\nThe multi-state model describes a process where individuals move among a series of states over time. It is increasingly popular in a wide range of applications in biostatistics.\nGenerally, if death is one state, the multi-state model can be seen as an extension of survival analysis. In most studies, covariate effects are fixed effects. These effects do not take into account unobserved heterogeneity with respect to individual or group level effects. In multi-state models, unobserved heterogeneity in rates of moving from one state to another is often present. In survival analysis, such an effect is called a frailty.\nMy PhD research is focusing on frailty models. For instance, exploring different distribution of frailties, defining frailties in different transitions, and multivariate frailty models. Including frailty effects helps to improve model performance under the Markov assumption. In multi-state models, we assume that the continuous-time multi-state model is a Markov process, which implies that future states are only determined by the current states. It is known that in reality the transition hazard may be affected by the time spent in previous states, implying that the future not only depends on current states but also the past, breaking the Markov assumption. For example, individuals who have spent more time in a diseased state are more likely to move towards death. This can be addressed using a frailty model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsma Saleh\nI consider Tobit models, which refer to censored or truncated regression models in which the range of the dependent variable is constrained in some way.\nFor example, a leading model used to deal with censored data is the Tobit 1 model, which is used to analyse household expenditure on durable goods against income where the expenditure cannot be negative. The main challenge with such models is that ignoring censoring will generally lead to inconsistent and biased estimators. In the example above, because the expenditure is observed only when it is positive, conventional regression methods like ordinary least squares estimators for the relationship between household expenditure and income are downwardly biased. In my PhD I consider variations of the Tobit 1 model for the general problem known as sample selection.\nThis means that observational studies are rarely based on pure random samples. Instead, a sample is based in part on values taken by a dependent variable which gives rise to sample selection bias. The most popular solution is a two-stage procedure proposed by Heckman, called the Heckit estimator, combining a probit maximum likelihood procedure and simple linear regression.\nI am investigating the performance of implicit bias reduction techniques such as the modified score equations method of Firth (1993) and the indirect inference method of Kuk (1995), through simulation and contrasting them with the standard maximum likelihood estimation and the Heckman two-step estimation procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarta Campi\nMy research focuses on non-stationary basis decomposition methods in time-frequency analysis.\nClassical methodologies in the field of time-frequency analysis rely on strong statistical assumptions that may not be valid in real data scenarios and modern applications. This work is based on a class of methods known as the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). The EMD is a non-parametric time-series decomposition technique, in which a time-series basis called the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) is extracted, which has specific statistical properties.\nThe main focus is offering a very general applicable family of basis extraction methods with relatively few requirements. This is highly important for two main reasons: firstly, more universal applications can be taken into account; secondly, the EMD has very little a priori knowledge of the process required in order to apply it.\nThe application taken into account here is related to Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) technologies. As with any biometric system, ASV is subject to spoofing attacks which mimic a target speaker’s voice in person or remotely via artificial tools. The EMD is employed to extract features of speech signals to assess their discrimination power for the classification of real and synthetic voices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMai Ngoc Bui\nOur main interest is covariance matrices, which appear in many contexts, such as in diffusion tensor imaging and volatilities for multiple financial assets.\nThe space of symmetric positive definite matrices is not only a convex cone, but also a smooth manifold. By endowing it with different Riemannian metrics, one can get different Riemannian structures of the manifold. There are two commonly used Riemannian metrics, namely the Log-Euclidean (LE) and Affine-Invariant (AI) metrics. Although much progress has been made towards reducing the computational cost of working with these, there are still many challenges if the goal is to employ a sampling algorithm on such a space.\nOur interest lies in constructing an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process on the space of covariance matrices, and fitting this model to data. For high-frequency data, the likelihood can be approximated using the Euler-Maruyama method in terms of the exponential map, making inference feasible. In the low-frequency setting, however, this is no longer possible.\nIn Euclidean space, the common approach is to use a data-augmentation algorithm, i.e. imputing latent data points between each adjacent pair of observations to allow the Euler-Maruyama method to give a better approximation to the likelihood. To do the same on a manifold requires a bridge sampler method on manifold. We have developed such a bridge sampler method, meaning that inference for low-frequency data can be performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcel Hirt\nI am interested in Bayesian inference, particularly when the computation of the posterior distribution is challenging.\nApproximation methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can be unsatisfactory because they scale poorly to large datasets. I have therefore been working on variational inference methods that instead of sampling from the posterior distribution, try to solve an optimization problem: find a distribution within some variational family that is close to the posterior distribution. However, if the variational family is not very flexible, one can end up with a bias, in contrast to MCMC methods that have some asymptotic guarantees.\nConstructing good approximation families has been an ongoing challenge, because such families should be both flexible but also computationally efficient at the same time. A classic approach is to assume a so called mean-field variational family, where all components are independent. While computationally efficient, this can be a poor approximation. I have developed a new approximating family motivated by copulas. The basic idea to sample from this new distribution is to first sample from a distribution on the hypercube and then apply Gaussian quantile functions and a rotation. The resulting distribution can be more flexible than a Gaussian approximation.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew ‘copula-like’ variational family approximation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay on top of the latest news and research coming from the Department of Statistical Science by visiting: www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics."

    "section": "",
    "text": "When I moved to London in September 2019, I never expected that I would be able to divide my graduate studies into two parts: experiences pre- and during a worldwide pandemic.\nWhile studying for a BSc in Economics and Management in Hanover, Germany, I discovered my passion for statistics and programming. To further dive into these topics and get a completely new perspective on academic life, I decided to apply for graduate degrees in data science in the UK. In the end, UCL’s MSc Data Science programme drew me in with its combination of rigorous statistical training offered by the Department of Statistical Science and insights into recent topics in machine learning provided by the Department of Computer Science. Of course, I was also excited to join the truly diverse and international community at UCL, and to enjoy the vibrant city of London.\nAfter a foundation fortnight bringing all students from mathematical and statistical backgrounds to the same page, I attended courses ranging from introductions to data science and machine learning to selected advanced topics in statistics. The module contents did not fall short of my expectations. What I particularly enjoyed, however, was being taught by lecturers who are on the frontier of research in their field, but very approachable and open for discussion at the same time. My cohort turned out to be a group of extremely smart people coming from a broad range of academic backgrounds, with each bringing in different perspectives. The group assignments ended up being especially inspiring for that reason.\nTo find a balance between studying and relaxation, I also enjoyed playing for the UCL tennis team. For BUCS Wednesdays, we travelled through England and Wales, and the tennis society became something of a home away from home.\nWhile the threat of a COVID-19 pandemic started looming on the horizon by the end of February 2020, it was only by the end of March that we could feel the immediate impact at UCL. Lectures finally had to move online for the last week of term 2 and social gatherings were cancelled altogether. However, both the Statistical Science and Computer Science departments did a great job of making a smooth transition, and quickly prepared online exams as well as other alternative assessments that could be taken from around the world. Clearly, this was a difficult time for everyone, but all kinds of online events organised by fellow students and societies helped us stay connected during lockdown.\nAfter the exam period, the MSc programme culminated in a research project. The disruption caused by the pandemic led to supervision being online rather than face-to-face, but I felt this worked perfectly well. I worked on a project on ‘Scalable inference for generative models using quasi-Monte Carlo’ supervised by Dr François-Xavier Briol, which pushed me far beyond everything I had learnt so far. Working on the MSc project itself would have been an intense and challenging experience at any time, but doing so in the isolation of a lockdown in a foreign country was even more so. However, through great support from my supervisor and my fellow students, with whom I could exchange thoughts and feedback, it also became a very rewarding time.\nAfter completing the MSc project, my supervisor proposed turning the thesis into a paper in a joint effort with another student, Ziang Niu, who was visiting the Statistical Science department as an undergraduate student during that year. As this was the first paper I had worked on, I was going through all stages of a research project for the first time, learning how a collaboration, in which everyone has their specialisations, results in very efficient teamwork.\nWriting this paper gave me the opportunity to develop my scientific coding and writing skills further, all of which provided me with a head start for the PhD that I am now pursuing in Hanover, Germany. Here, my work is focused on the intersection of machine learning and time series analysis, and I am still profiting from the great network I was able to build through the Statistical Science department at UCL. Many of my fellow students went into research, both in academia and industry, and we keep in touch, motivating and stimulating each other.\nIn retrospect, coming to London to pursue the MSc Data Science gave me so much more than a degree – it boosted my quantitative skills and left me with a network of bright and caring people, despite the COVID-19 disruptions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "On Monday 20th September 2021, after a lengthy period of lockdown, the department organised an outdoor get-together in the gardens of the Freud Museum in London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe event was organised for two reasons. Firstly, to remind each other of what we looked like in person – following around 18 months of online meetings – and to communally prepare for the new academic year. Secondly, to acknowledge a change at the top, as Professor Richard Chandler stepped down as head of department following his five-year tenure, to be replaced by the incoming Professor Gianluca Baio.\nProfessor Chandler oversaw many changes during his time at the helm. The past five years have been a period of expansion and relative success for the department, as the popularity of data science as a discipline has continued to grow.\nBut of course, a very significant part of his role was to lead the department through the pandemic. It was a period in which many difficult decisions had to be made in a very short space of time, amidst an ever-changing landscape of new government rules and recommendations. This meant employing different modes of teaching and modified expectations on how both staff and students should conduct themselves within the (at many times virtual) department.\nUpon stepping down, Professor Chandler received a special departmental award, acknowledging his efforts in “guiding the department through a period of expansion and a global pandemic.”\nOf course, another good reason for the meeting was to have some fun, and despite the provision of an emergency gazebo in case of rain, the sun shone brightly – a welcome reminder that Murphy’s law still carries with it some notion of uncertainty.\nOne of the highlights of the day was the soft archery session conducted by Discovery Archery Ltd. A special mention for bravery goes to Professor Codina Cotar, who volunteered herself without hesitation when the organisers asked if anyone was prepared to act as a human target. Students beware, Professor Cotar has nerves of steel!\nOther shenanigans included a mime artist, a giant chess board and a carnival ‘test your strength’ machine, an activity that – funnily enough – no-one among the faculty seemed to be very adept at.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a great day, and served to mark the achievements of the departing Professor Chandler with high spirits and smiles all round."

    "text": "Staff perspectives on the challenges of being locked down\n\n\nDr Elinor Jones\nAssociate Professor – Teaching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere were you working during the lockdown/remote working period?\nI worked from my home, tucked away in a corner of my living room. As I don’t live in London, remote working was initially a novelty: I didn’t miss the commute to London! However, the novelty quickly wore off.\nHow much did your university experience change during lockdown versus before the pandemic?\nIt was like having a new job. I barely recognised it. The switch from ‘everything face to face’ to ‘everything online’ happened almost overnight.\nWere there any aspects of lockdown teaching that you found particularly challenging?\nMany! The university encouraged us to teach using a flipped method: make material available before a live session then use the session to review the material. For me, this meant completely rewriting two modules so that they would work in this format. That was a huge amount of work over a short period of time. Then came the live sessions themselves… It was hard to teach when very few students turned on their cameras. Teaching is the highlight of my job and not being able to see who I was teaching was disheartening. I hadn’t realised before this point just how much I relied on facial expressions of students to determine whether I was making any sense!\nWere there any aspects that you preferred to in-person teaching?\nErm… I’m struggling to think of any to be honest. I did quite like the flipped learning style, and think I’ll carry on doing at least some of that in future.\nDid you manage to stay connected with colleagues and research collaborators?\nYes and no. I was more connected to some of my colleagues: I was having daily Teams/Zoom calls with people who I would have usually seen for a few minutes each week for a quick hello in the corridor. The flip side to that was that I was less connected to other people that I would have usually spent quite a bit of time with each week. That’s going to take quite some time to build up again.\nWhat kind of university experience (fully in-person or a blend of in-person and remote) do you hope for going forward?\nI’m hoping that the experience of the pandemic will mean that we find a way of combining the best of both worlds. For me, that means collaborating with students to figure out what works best when teaching statistics. My gut instinct is that the flexibility that online learning gives is valued by students, but in-person teaching is more effective in getting ideas across. I’m hoping we’ll find a good balance, though it may take a few years of experimenting.\n\n\nDr Simon Harden\nAssociate Professor – Teaching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere were you working during the lockdown/remote working period?\nIn the Derbyshire Peak District.\nHow much did your university experience change during lockdown versus before the pandemic?\nCompletely. COVID plus teaching took up all my time, so research and book writing (activities which might be equally well-managed remotely) stopped.\nWere there any aspects of lockdown teaching that you found particularly challenging?\nAll of it: particularly seeing how students react to what you are saying.\nWere there any aspects that you preferred to in-person teaching?\nNo.\nDid you manage to stay connected with colleagues and research collaborators?\nIt was easier to have brief contact with more people (which I did), but I don’t regard online as a good substitute for face-to-face: it’s quantity but not quality.\nWhat kind of university experience (fully in-person or a blend of in-person and remote) do you hope for going forward?\nIn person as much as possible. I think the move to more flipped classroom style teaching is a good one (not sure the students feel the same), and we have more teaching tools in our armoury, but there is no substitute for being face-to-face with students, whether in large lectures, tutorials, supervision or personal tutor meetings.\n\n\nDr Thomas Honnor\nLecturer – Teaching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere were you working during the lockdown/remote working period?\nI began the lockdown working from my bedroom in a shared flat in London. Once it became clear that remote working would last for a longer stretch, and play a greater role for the foreseeable future, I moved outside of London, into a place where I could have a dedicated working space and also be closer to family.\nHow much did your university experience change during lockdown versus before the pandemic?\nAs a teaching-focused member of staff, pre-lockdown a typical day would involve me being on campus, teaching and meeting with students and other members of staff. When lockdown began, that was turned on its head, with in-person tutorial teaching a rare treat only possible during periods of more relaxed regulations. The shift was quite dramatic and certainly took some time to acclimatise to.\nWere there any aspects of lockdown teaching that you found particularly challenging?\nI find securing student interaction to be a challenge at the best of times, and this was made more difficult with the move to teaching online. Teaching to a Zoom call where no-one else has their cameras on is certainly not as rewarding as teaching in-person, but with practice it was possible to develop techniques to secure more engagement.\nWere there any aspects that you preferred to in-person teaching?\nPre-lockdown, I struggled to see the benefits and feasibility of flipped learning. The move towards online teaching allowed me to pre-record lectures and spend the live sessions diving into applications and discussing interesting links between related concepts.\nDid you manage to stay connected with colleagues and research collaborators?\nI enjoyed the regular department Zoom calls, where we could catch up on the latest news, alongside the odd bit of humour to lighten the mood. The group of teaching-focused staff in the department arranged similar regular calls, which were very useful to chat about all sorts of topics at a time when teaching and assessment were undergoing significant changes.\nWhat kind of university experience (fully in-person or a blend of in-person and remote) do you hope for going forward?\nI can see advantages to a blend of in-person teaching and resources made available online. I’ve been lucky enough to experience a good amount of in-person teaching in the past year and it certainly has its advantages, but there remains a place for the accessibility and convenience of online sessions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Department of Statistical Science, in conjunction with the Royal Statistical Society, hosted a symposium on Teaching Statistics in April 2019. The event was organised by the department’s Teaching Fellows, with the aim of bringing together those who teach statistics in higher education to hear about, and discuss, exciting developments in the field. Over 60 people from around the UK attended and took part in a number of lively debates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first session focused on teaching non-statisticians and featured contributions from Margaret MacDougall (University of Edinburgh), who discussed the statistics that medical students need to learn and how they might retain that knowledge in the long term, and Charalampos Chanialidis (University of Glasgow), who described how an online MSc in Data Analytics was established and implemented. Virtual learning and approaches to teaching non-statisticians both provoked interesting discussion.\nAfter lunch we concentrated on teaching statisticians. Elke Thonnes (University of Warwick) considered authentic learning which provides useful data-centric skills for students including statistical consultancy, and then Paul Northrop (UCL) talked about a research-based learning initiative wherein undergraduates read an academic paper, discuss it with the author and then summarise their findings. Both included a section on group assessment which was clearly of interest to many present.\nThe symposium concluded with a panel discussion on the future of teaching statistics. Panel members included Rachel Hilliam from the Open University, Andy Field from the University of Sussex (who is known for his cartoon-based books on statistics), and Sharon Witherspoon, the Royal Statistical Society’s Vice President for Education and Statistical Literacy. The discussion encompassed subjects such as data science, the use of statistical software, short courses for professionals and remote teaching. These topics exemplified the diversity of approaches that will inevitably proliferate over the coming years.\nThe symposium was followed by the launch of the RSS Special Interest Group on Teaching Statistics, chaired by Elinor Jones (UCL)."

The department’s equality and diversity committee, chaired by Alex Donov and Niloufar Abourashchi, meets regularly and works to ensure that the principles of the charter are upheld.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring my first meeting with Alex Donov, he explained that at UCL Statistics, there are roughly equal proportions of men and women across the BSc and MSc levels. However, from the PhD level onwards, there is an imbalance: the proportion of male students is larger.\nTo find out more about this imbalance, surveys were conducted among groups of students in the department. I was responsible for the processing and analysis of a survey conducted among a cohort of MSc students at the end of their course. The main tasks were filing the paper survey answers into an electronic data set and analysing this data set. The analysis mainly consisted of trying out different techniques to visualise the data as clearly as possible. In the next Athena SWAN meeting, I will present the results from this analysis.\nSo far, I have really enjoyed working on the project. It feels as if the work is appreciated and I was given real responsibility, which is very motivating. I have learned a lot in the process, partly because of useful feedback on my work and partly because it was a nice challenge to rise to. I hope to contribute some ideas based on the data in the upcoming months.\nLook out for Doranne’s results in a future edition of Sample Space.\n\n\nThe Numbers Game\nUCL has long been at the forefront of promoting women within mathematical sciences.\nTwenty-five years ago, the department initiated a Celebrating Women in Mathematics day, aimed at encouraging aspiring female mathematicians to study at UCL. With the ongoing commitment of staff and students, this event has run almost every year since, and is now a firmly established annual departmental event.\nPast events, including Celebrating Women in Mathematics, have attracted audiences numbering over 300. And the cross-departmental meeting series UCL Women in Mathematical Sciences, which organises several events per year, is also highly subscribed.\nThe IMSS will enable us to increase our engagement with groups that are under-represented within the discipline, and ensure that UK mathematical science attracts talent that is as diverse as possible."

    "text": "I am very excited to introduce the second issue of the departmental magazine in my relatively new role as Head of the Department — I took over from Richard Chandler in September 2021 (you can read some sassy details of the transition in this issue). You may judge me if I say this out loud but I was, and still am, very excited and proud to become the head of the department where, essentially, I have spent my entire adult career!\nThe last two years have been incredibly complicated for everyone and our community has certainly been no exception — I think we owe my predecessor a great debt of gratitude for all of his hard work, as we navigated through the Covid years. All of us had to come to terms with a different way of living and working, including amusing hours of home-schooling the children, while converting all our lecture slides into html formats and figuring out how to deliver an online lecture while ensuring that at least one of the students was still awake by the end of it!\nIt goes without saying, but I will nonetheless say thank you to all our amazing staff, who have gone beyond the call of duty. And of course, to all our students who had to live through the most absurd university experience. In this issue, we’ve collected some testimonies both from our staff and our students), as well as reported on some important work related to the pandemic emergency.\nBehind the scenes, a lot has been going on in the department (including some modern day testing experiments): in particular, we have continued our trajectory of sustained growth in our staff and the last two years have seen a significant intake of exciting new colleagues. I am particularly pleased with the fantastic group of early career researchers that we have managed to attract in the past few years — some of our new colleagues introduce themselves in this issue. Their work has contributed to revive the vibrant environment in the department and expand the breadth of research themes and excellence in our community, including amongst our amazing PhD students.\nSpeaking of research, I am also pleased to report that our results for the Research Excellence Framework (REF) exercise have been positive — our submission is joint with our cousins in Mathematics. We have improved on several metrics, including research impact and we are ranked fifth on “4/3” (which is an overall measure of world-leading and internationally excellent research). We now rank eighth for “research power” (a measure of research quality, weighted by the number of staff returned) and we are very close to the institutions sitting immediately above us in this metric. Personally, I think that we are still on a journey and we haven’t fully reaped the fruits of our investments in human resources and that the next one will be the REF in which we graduate to top five. I hope that we will continue to establish further our community and the sense of belonging for all our staff and students.\nIn the time since the last issue of Sample Space, we have also worked hard to establish a presence on several social medial channels: we now have a quite vibrant Twitter account and are active on Instagram and LinkedIn. This may sound unnecessarily chirpy and hipster, but I think these have already been very good media to generate discussion and showcase many of the activities that go on in the department (including the brilliant widening participation effort of Data Detectives, described here) and so I am personally pleased that we have started developing them — for which I definitely need to thank our “Social Media Team” of Sam Livinstone, Javier Rubio, Brieuc Lehmann and Audrey Gbato.\nWe’ve also started our podcast series (aptly named “Random Talks”), thanks to the brilliant work of Sam, Terry Soo, Nathan Green and Brieuc, who have already produced some super-interesting episodes, including one where Tom Fearn tells about his experience sitting on the UCL eugenics inquiry, which is also presented in this issue."

    "text": "Welcome to our first edition of Sample Space, a newsletter that aims to keep our community of past and present students and staff in touch with what’s happening in Statistical Science at UCL. I hope you find the contents interesting: we plan to do more of this kind of thing in the future, to keep you all updated with the latest news from the department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCL Statistical Science is currently undergoing a period of significant expansion: this is part undergoing of and a strategic operational investment in mathematics, statistics and operational research that will lead to the establishment of a UCL Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, or IMSS for short. We plan for the Statistical Science and Mathematics departments to be re-housed next to each other on a single site, in a purpose-designed facility that will put UCL on the map as one of the ‘go-to’ places for the mathematical sciences in London – and that will also provide our students with a much greater sense of community than is currently possible. Bringing this idea to fruition has already taken considerable effort, and will continue to do so in the coming months and years, although I strongly believe that the rewards will be well worth it. Apart from anything else, being bigger gives us additional resources to do things like producing Sample Space!\nThe department has also recently established a new master’s programme in Data Science, which has proven very popular with students. A recent graduate, Mete Veyisoglu, has kindly taken the time to share his experiences of the programme in this issue. Further curriculum developments are being undertaken at the moment to ensure that we continue to equip our students with the tools to be statistically literate, perhaps a more desirable skill than ever in today’s world.\nOn the research side, the recent announcement of a large increase in UK government funding for the mathematical sciences is very welcome, and particularly timely in view of our IMSS expansion plans. Final preparations are underway for REF 2021, the latest iteration of the UK’s ‘Research Excellence Framework’. The department’s performance in this exercise will also contribute to the level of government funding we receive for the next few years. We have excellent staff doing exciting and incredibly diverse research, some of which is making a real impact outside academia: this issue highlights work being done by Serge Guillas and his team on understanding tsunami risk around the world.\nAs always, there are external challenges: as I write, UK universities are grappling with the uncertainties posed by Brexit and, more urgently, by the worldwide Covid-19 outbreak. UCL Statistical Science is such a thoroughly international community that these issues will certainly affect us to some extent. I very much hope, however, that the effects will be minimal for all of us.\nFinally, I would like to extend my very sincere thanks to everyone who contributed to this first issue of Sample Space, and in particular to Samuel Livingstone for coordinating and editing it. If any readers have feedback, or potential contributions to future issues, or suggestions for material that they’d like to see, please contact him at samuel.livingstone@ucl.ac.uk. I think he and all the contributors have done a fantastic job: I hope you do too."

    "text": "The Eugenics Legacy Education Project (ELEP) at UCL began in September 2022 as a direct result of the UCL Eugenics Inquiry Response report. The report recommended a programme of education activity be undertaken to explore the ways that teaching and learning practices at UCL can take account of the historical links to eugenics and to consider the implications for current and future educational activities. Confronting the harms of eugenics as an educational endeavor means critically reflecting on issues such as the role of curriculum development, planning staff support and learning, the use of high-quality resources for teaching historical and contemporary issues as well as opportunities develop productive pedagogies when teaching this ‘difficult knowledge’.\nELEP has five strands of activity designed to develop our collective educational capacity to include teaching about UCL’s eugenics legacy in contextually appropriate and discipline specific ways. We are keen to work with colleagues across disciplines at UCL and are particularly looking forward to collaborating with the Department of Statistical Science since there has been some important work taking place before ELEP was established. For example, Professor Tom Fearn’s podcast on the history of statistics and eugenics outlines the importance of a continuing engagement with the harms of the eugenics discourse and ways to address this in our educational activities. The process of de-naming of rooms and buildings associated with eugenicists and the plaque that marks this process is an important opportunity to think about the educational opportunities this creates for engagement with reparative educational futures. The continuing work on inclusion and diversity that is evident when talking to senior leadership in the department prompts questions around the relationship between strategies for developing and supporting the flourishing of diverse communities in the shadow of our eugenics history.\nThe Eugenics Inquiry Response Report acknowledged the complexity of developing teaching and learning activities that might confront and address eugenics legacies at UCL.

    "text": "The Eugenics Legacy Education Project (ELEP) at UCL began in September 2022 as a direct result of the UCL Eugenics Inquiry Response report. The report recommended a programme of education activity be undertaken to explore the ways that teaching and learning practices at UCL can take account of the historical links to eugenics and to consider the implications for current and future educational activities. Confronting the harms of eugenics as an educational endeavor means critically reflecting on issues such as the role of curriculum development, planning staff support and learning, the use of high-quality resources for teaching historical and contemporary issues as well as opportunities develop productive pedagogies when teaching this ‘difficult knowledge’.\nELEP has five strands of activity designed to develop our collective educational capacity to include teaching about UCL’s eugenics legacy in contextually appropriate and discipline specific ways. We are keen to work with colleagues across disciplines at UCL and are particularly looking forward to collaborating with the Department of Statistical Science since there has been some important work taking place before ELEP was established. For example, Professor Tom Fearn’s podcast on the history of statistics and eugenics outlines the importance of a continuing engagement with the harms of the eugenics discourse and ways to address this in our educational activities. The process of de-naming of rooms and buildings associated with eugenicists and the plaque that marks this process is an important opportunity to think about the educational opportunities this creates for engagement with reparative educational futures. The continuing work on inclusion and diversity that is evident when talking to senior leadership in the department prompts questions around the relationship between strategies for developing and supporting the flourishing of diverse communities in the shadow of our eugenics history.\nThe Eugenics Inquiry Response Report acknowledged the complexity of developing teaching and learning activities that might confront and address eugenics legacies at UCL.

One of them read, “Young Men 30 Times More Likely to Get Heart Inflammation from Covid-19 mRNA Booster Than Young Women.” You read that and think, “Whoa! Pump the brakes on vaccinating young lads!” But wait, before we go full panic mode, let’s channel our inner detective and investigate further!\nThe Clues in the Numbers\nLet’s crack the case by examining the data of the published study. Out of 295,288 young men (aged 16-29), only 31 experienced heart inflammation after getting vaccinated. And on the other side, just one out of 298,260 young women had a similar reaction. That’s like trying to find a needle in a haystack! Only 0.000105% of young men and 0.000004% of young women got that heart inflammation. To put it simply, 1 in 10,000 young men and 1 in about 300,000 young women had this health hiccup. As you chew on this data, imagine COVID-19 as a not-so-friendly game opponent, and unvaccinated young individuals as the brave challengers. With a 2% fatality rate, about 6,000 lives might be at stake in a cohort of 300,000! That’s like a seriously challenging level in the game of life!\nPlaying Detective with Relative Measures\nNow, here’s the tricky part! The news headline flaunted a flashy relative measure called “relative risk.” It makes the difference between young men and women look huge! But hold your horses, folks, ’cause we need to factor in the absolute risk difference. And what do we find? Drumroll, please! The actual difference is only 0.0101%. That’s like trying to find a drop of water in the desert! Talk about being fooled by numbers!\nThe Big Reveal\nSo, what’s the takeaway from this thrilling investigation? Those relative measures can be real pranksters, making things seem scarier than they are! To be informed properly and make the right choices, we need to go beyond the flashy headlines and dive into the nuts and bolts. Embrace the Sherlock Holmes within you and seek the bigger picture!\nConclusion\nAlright, folks, we’ve cracked the code! When it comes to relative risks, let’s not fall for those mischievous headlines. With the power of context and critical thinking on our arsenal, we can make wise choices to protect ourselves and our communities. So, let’s give a big round of applause to science!

    "section": "",
    "text": "In recent times, the field of behavioural science has been rocked by controversies involving prominent researchers Dan Ariely and Francesca Gino. These controversies raise crucial questions about ethics, data integrity, and the pursuit of truth in academic research. Both Ariely and Gino, known for their groundbreaking studies in human behaviour and decision-making, have faced allegations of data manipulation and misconduct, casting a shadow over their reputations and the field itself.\nDan Ariely, a charismatic and unconventional figure in academia, has conducted daring studies throughout his career. However, it’s his more recent controversies that have attracted attention. One of his experiments involved administering electric shocks to Craigslist volunteers, falsely claiming they were testing a painkiller. This led to accusations of ethical violations and a one-year suspension from data collection. Additionally, he reportedly offered hush money to a participant to keep the issue quiet. But Ariely’s questionable data practices have extended beyond these incidents. Discrepancies in research data and allegations of misrepresenting his studies raised concerns about his commitment to scientific rigour. Critics argue that Ariely prioritised storytelling and publicity over adherence to rigorous scientific standards.\nFrancesca Gino, another respected behavioural scientist, has also faced accusations of data manipulation in her studies. While her work has been prolific, questions have also arisen about the authenticity of her results. Ariely and Gino often collaborated on studies related to dishonesty, shedding light on the dark side of human creativity and the counterfeit self. One of their groundbreaking studies involved having participants wear counterfeit designer sunglasses, leading to increased cheating behaviour. Their research exposed how subtle influences could affect human behaviour. These collaborations brought them recognition and fame in the world of behavioural science.\nOne study that Gino lead, claimed to have discovered that participants who were asked to sign truthfulness declarations at the top of the page were more honest than those who were asked to sign the declarations at the bottom of the page. However, a 14-page document later compiled by Havard University (where Gino worked) included “compelling evidence” of data falsification, including the discovery that someone accessed a database and added and altered data in the file. It was also found that an Excel data spreadsheet related to the study that was sent to co-author Nina Mazar contained metadata that showed that the Excel file was created, and last edited, by a user named Dan Ariely.\nThe controversies surrounding Ariely and Gino have ignited discussions about the state of behavioural science as a whole. Some argue that the pressure to produce groundbreaking results and secure funding may tempt researchers to cut corners or sensationalise their findings. The ongoing replication crisis in behavioural science, where many studies fail to reproduce previous results, has only exacerbated these concerns.\nIn response to these challenges, there is a growing movement advocating for scientific rigour and transparency in research. The “credibility revolution” encourages researchers to prioritise truth over novelty, emphasising incremental progress, curiosity, and adherence to reality instead of sensational findings. This shift aims to reorient the field towards ethical conduct and data integrity.\nThe controversies surrounding Dan Ariely and Francesca Gino serve as cautionary tales, reminding the scientific community of the importance of ethics, transparency, and data integrity in research. These cases underscore the need for researchers, institutions, and the broader scientific community to uphold the highest standards of conduct to preserve the credibility of behavioural science. Ultimately, the pursuit of knowledge must always be guided by an unwavering commitment to truth and ethical principles."

    "text": "The archiving of material our department gave to UCL Special Collections has now been completed. This means the material is ready for researchers to access and gain new insight.\nThe material we gave to Leah Johnston from Special Collections was originally stored in the Statistical Science basement for decades. No one working here was aware of their existence until the basement was tidied up. This is because records were not kept, it was just a bunch of papers to look at.\nDue to the increased interest in tackling the difficult history of our department’s involvement in eugenics, we thought it was important to get the items properly archived so that researchers can access them.\nThe difference in perspective that time gives when looking back at how our very own department used to operate makes any new research into these objects potentially groundbreaking. This is because the attitudes towards many issues has changed over the years, and we are often shocked by what was considered normal in the past. New research will therefore have a different angle and lens by which to analyse.\nSpecifically, we can claim to have donated the “Photograph of Francis Galton seated on his porch” and “Women working in laboratory” photographs from Leah’s press release, but we also donated much more which is available in the Hierarchy Browser link.\nThe Statistical Science staff involved in donating the material were Stephanie Dickinson and Dr Simon Harden.\nLeah Johnston has written a blog post about it all here: https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/special-collections/2023/09/07/galton-laboratory-records/\nThe archive information can be accessed via the online catalogue. Anyone who is interested in finding material on there can carry out a keyword search from the homepage. This will turn up material across the collections, so may also bring up material from others such as Galton and Pearsons’ personal archives. Alternatively, to find the Galton Laboratory Records collection, you will need to select the Advanced search option on the homepage and type ‘Galton laboratory’ into the Reference Number search field and press return. This should take you directly to the collection level description. For ease of access however, this is the link to the page which shows an overview of the entire collection: https://archives.ucl.ac.uk/CalmView/TreeBrowse.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&field=RefNo&key=GALTON+LABORATORY."

    "text": "Image credit: Northern Rock Queue 2007, by Dominic Alves, Brighton, U.K. Reused under the CC BY 2.0 license\nOn the use of artificial intelligence in financial regulations and the impact on financial stability [1] explores the growing role of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial authorities and its implications for both micro-regulations and macro-regulations within the financial sector. It argues that while AI holds significant promise in enhancing micro-regulations, dealing with daily matters like risk management and consumer protection, its application in macro-regulations, which focus on the overall stability of the financial system, faces substantial challenges.\nThe authors introduce six criteria for evaluating the suitability of AI use in the private sector and financial regulation. These criteria serve as essential guidelines for determining the effectiveness of AI implementation. They include the availability of sufficient data, the stability of regulatory rules, the ability to establish clear objectives, the capacity for independent decision-making by AI, the establishment of accountability mechanisms to address mistakes and misbehavior, and an understanding of the potential consequences of errors in the AI-driven decision-making process.\nFurthermore, the article delves into the variations in the nature of tasks performed by AI in the financial sector, ranging from providing advice to making independent decisions. It highlights the significance of comprehending AI’s objectives, which can be predefined by human operators or learned from human feedback during the training phase. The authors stress the need for financial authorities to adapt to the increasing prevalence of AI in the private sector and its potential impact on various functions, including regulatory design, supervisory decision-making, and crisis resolution.\nThe article underscores the challenges associated with AI adoption in the financial sector, particularly in the realm of macro-regulations. It examines the limitations stemming from the scarcity of relevant data, the unique and infrequent nature of financial crises, the complexities of managing dynamic interactions within the financial system, and the difficulties in defining objectives during crisis resolution. The article underscores the importance of understanding the risks and challenges associated with AI use in macro-regulations, emphasizing the need for human oversight and intervention in critical decision-making processes.\nMoreover, the article explores the complexities of AI decision-making in the context of crisis resolution, emphasizing the challenges posed by emergent information and interests that are characteristic of crisis situations. It discusses the limitations of AI in comprehending and responding to these emergent factors, highlighting the significance of human intuition and understanding in the effective management of crises.\nThe article also delves into the potential implications of AI implementation in the financial sector, particularly in terms of its impact on decision-making processes, regulatory oversight, and systemic risk management. It discusses the risks associated with the overreliance on AI in decision-making and emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance between AI-driven analysis and human intervention.\nThe article further touches upon the concept of AI explainability and the challenges in making AI decision-making processes transparent and understandable. It underscores the ongoing efforts to address this issue, particularly in the context of regulatory oversight.\nOverall, the article underscores the significance of understanding the nuances and complexities of AI implementation in the financial sector, emphasizing the need for a cautious, well-informed, and adaptive approach to AI integration. It stresses the importance of human oversight, accountability, and adaptability in ensuring the effectiveness and stability of financial regulations and crisis resolution processes in an increasingly AI-driven financial landscape."

    "text": "This work conducted a contemporary cost-effectiveness analysis examining the use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) for primary prevention in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).\nA traditional ICD is a small battery-powered device placed in the chest with wires, called leads, attached to the heart. It detects and stops irregular heartbeats. An ICD continuously checks the heartbeat and delivers electric shocks, when needed, to restore a regular heart rhythm.\nA discrete-time Markov model was used to determine the cost-effectiveness of different ICD decision-making rules for implantation. Several scenarios were investigated including the reference scenario of implantation rates according to observed real world practice. A 12-year time horizon with an annual cycle length was used. Transition probabilities used in the model were obtained using Bayesian analysis.\nUsing a 5-year SCD risk threshold of 6% was cheaper than current practice and has marginally better total quality adjusted life years (QALYs). This is the most cost-effective of the options considered, with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of £834 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses highlighted that this decision is largely driven by what health related quality of life (HRQL) is attributed to ICD patients and time horizon.\nWhile we have shown that a 6% 5-year SCD risk cut-off provides the best cohort stratification to aid ICD decision-making, this will also be influenced by the particular values of costs and HRQL for subgroups or at a local level. The process of explicitly demonstrating the main factors which drive conclusions from such an analysis will help to inform shared decision-making in this complex area for all stakeholders concerned."

    "text": "David Cox’s regression model for right-censored data has had an enormous impact on survival analysis. Survival analysis typically considers data-sets in which time-to-death is recorded as the main outcome: such data-sets typically also contain data on those who survived past the follow-up period (i.e., right-censoring). The Cox regression model solves this problem, in addition to facilitating computations and interpretation of results, and hence has become very widely used in medical statistics and beyond, e.g., to test the predictive ability of medical biomarkers.\nThe Dirichlet process (1973) forms the basis for, amongst other things, Bayesian non-parametrics (BNP). Statisticians and data-scientists are used to thinking about distributions of data values. But BNP stretches this definition of a distribution, to a distribution of distributions. Since a random variable with a continuous distribution has an infinite number of possible values, we think of this as having an infinite number parameters, or alternatively as being non-parametric. The Dirichlet process models this distribution of distributions that is centered on a ‘base’ distribution (like a Gaussian), analogously to how a Gaussian models a distribution of data values centered on the mean. One particular success of this method is in data clustering, to automatically detect the number of clusters.\nThe AIC (1974) addresses the problem of overfitting in statistical modelling. Overfitting of statistical models occurs when the model has too much flexibility or complexity, so that after the model is fitted to data it represents the data too precisely, even including random variation that is not of interest. The consequence of overfitting is that the model then does not generalise well to new data-sets. The AIC overcomes this problem, by introducing a trade-off between how well the model fits the data, and the complexity of the model. As George Box said almost 50 years ago: ‘all models are wrong, but some models are useful’. The AIC encapsulates this trade-off by acknowledging that the model may need to deviate slightly from the observed data to maximise its utility in generalising to new data."

    "title": "Measuring the effect of the hostile environment policy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In 2012, the UK Government announced a series of immigration policy reforms known as the hostile environment policy, culminating in the so-called Windrush scandal. Several hundred Commonwealth citizens who had settled legally in the UK since World War II were falsely identified as “undocumented” and, in many cases, deported. This situation particularly affected people from Black Caribbean backgrounds who had legally immigrated to the UK in the previous decades, known as the “Windrush Generation”, from the name of one of the ships used to carry people, mostly from Jamaica to England.\nThis work is part of a research grant funded by the Wellcome Trust under the “Collaborative Award” scheme. The project, called “Evaluating Policy Implementations TO Predict MEntal health [EPITOME]: a Bayesian hierarchical framework for quasi-experimental designs in longitudinal settings” aims at developing methodology to draw causal inference (or as close as possible to that!…) for longitudinal data, accounting for their hierarchical nature, the existence of time series components and spatial and spatio-temporal correlation.\nMethodologically, the main idea is to use “quasi-experimental” designs, such as the “Interrupted Time Series”, to robustly rule out the impacts of potential confounders or biases in the assessment of changes in a particular outcome before and after a certain policy is introduced. In this specific case, we have data on nearly 60,000 participants in the UK Household Longitudinal Study, a large survey conducted at multiple time points and collecting a wide range of variables, including a widely used, self-administered questionnaire on psychological distress, the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). The details of the methodology are available here.\nSpecifially, we have investigate the impact of the “Immigration Act 2014”, requiring landlords, employers, the NHS, banks and the police to check right-to-stay documentation, which was a key part of the Home Office hostile environment policy, seeking to target people without leave to remain in the UK. We also investigated the impact of the Windrush scandal, after news reports from late 2017 onwards documented how the UK government had, over the preceding decades, been wrongly detaining British subjects who had come over from the Caribbean or threatening them with deportation.\nOur model analysis shows an increase in psychological distress in people of Black Caribbean heritage in the UK after 2014, relative to White study participants. This difference was a one-point decline on mental wellbeing on a scale of 1-36, which is slightly larger than the declines in mental health seen across the whole UK population at the time of the first Covid-19 lockdown, but, unlike the lockdown impact, the increased psychological distress in the Black Caribbean population persisted for several years. Black Caribbean study participants then experienced a further increase in psychological distress relative to the White population after the Windrush scandal. Further analysis revealed that the 2014 Act affected first generation Black Caribbean migrants more, while media coverage of the Windrush scandal affected British people of Caribbean heritage more.\nIn the figure above, green data points and lines represent mean GHQ-12 scores from the respective ethnic minority groups; black data points and lines represent mean GHQ-12 scores from the White ethnicity group. The red dashed line shows the implementation of the Immigration Act 2014 and the blue dashed line shows the start of the Windrush scandal media coverage. GHQ-12=General Health Questionnaire 12-item version. Our model did account for spatial correlation (based on the area in which respondents live), as well as the time trend.\nOur study highlights the harms to mental health that the government’s hostile environment policy had on certain groups of people, in addition to other well-documented harms such as deportation, job loss, eviction, and discrimination. The mental health impacts may have stemmed from the direct impacts of such threats to people’s homes and livelihoods, but could also have resulted from a wider, pervasive sense of racial injustice and bias, faced by a group already experiencing systemic and sometimes institutionalised racism and discrimination. When the Windrush scandal dominated the news, there may have been a risk of retraumatisation for some people, while even for those not directly affected, the scandal put the spotlight on people with minoritised ethnic backgrounds.\nGovernment policies can produce, maintain and exacerbate systemic inequities in mental health. Policymakers should consider the mental health impact of immigration policies, as they can impact not only prospective immigrants or people without leave to remain, but also those who are already settled legally in the country, and thus they should design them to minimise all harms including mental health inequalities. And appropriate statistical modelling and analysis can help uncover all this and improve decision-making and governmental action based on evidence."

This situation particularly affected people from Black Caribbean backgrounds who had legally immigrated to the UK in the previous decades, known as the “Windrush Generation”, from the name of one of the ships used to carry people, mostly from Jamaica to England.\nThis work is part of a research grant funded by the Wellcome Trust under the “Collaborative Award” scheme. The project, called “Evaluating Policy Implementations TO Predict MEntal health [EPITOME]: a Bayesian hierarchical framework for quasi-experimental designs in longitudinal settings” aims at developing methodology to draw causal inference (or as close as possible to that!…) for longitudinal data, accounting for their hierarchical nature, the existence of time series components and spatial and spatio-temporal correlation.\nMethodologically, the main idea is to use “quasi-experimental” designs, such as the “Interrupted Time Series”, to robustly rule out the impacts of potential confounders or biases in the assessment of changes in a particular outcome before and after a certain policy is introduced. In this specific case, we have data on nearly 60,000 participants in the UK Household Longitudinal Study, a large survey conducted at multiple time points and collecting a wide range of variables, including a widely used, self-administered questionnaire on psychological distress, the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). The details of the methodology are available here.\nSpecifially, we have investigated the impact of the “Immigration Act 2014”, requiring landlords, employers, the NHS, banks and the police to check right-to-stay documentation, which was a key part of the Home Office hostile environment policy, seeking to target people without leave to remain in the UK. We also investigated the impact of the Windrush scandal, after news reports from late 2017 onwards documented how the UK government had, over the preceding decades, been wrongly detaining British subjects who had come over from the Caribbean or threatening them with deportation.\nOur model analysis shows an increase in psychological distress in people of Black Caribbean heritage in the UK after 2014, relative to White study participants. This difference was a one-point decline on mental wellbeing on a scale of 1-36, which is slightly larger than the declines in mental health seen across the whole UK population at the time of the first Covid-19 lockdown, but, unlike the lockdown impact, the increased psychological distress in the Black Caribbean population persisted for several years. Black Caribbean study participants then experienced a further increase in psychological distress relative to the White population after the Windrush scandal. Further analysis revealed that the 2014 Act affected first generation Black Caribbean migrants more, while media coverage of the Windrush scandal affected British people of Caribbean heritage more.\nIn the figure above, green data points and lines represent mean GHQ-12 scores from the respective ethnic minority groups; black data points and lines represent mean GHQ-12 scores from the White ethnicity group. The red dashed line shows the implementation of the Immigration Act 2014 and the blue dashed line shows the start of the Windrush scandal media coverage. GHQ-12=General Health Questionnaire 12-item version. Our model did account for spatial correlation (based on the area in which respondents live), as well as the time trend.\nOur study highlights the harms to mental health that the government’s hostile environment policy had on certain groups of people, in addition to other well-documented harms such as deportation, job loss, eviction, and discrimination. The mental health impacts may have stemmed from the direct impacts of such threats to people’s homes and livelihoods, but could also have resulted from a wider, pervasive sense of racial injustice and bias, faced by a group already experiencing systemic and sometimes institutionalised racism and discrimination. When the Windrush scandal dominated the news, there may have been a risk of retraumatisation for some people, while even for those not directly affected, the scandal put the spotlight on people with minoritised ethnic backgrounds.\nGovernment policies can produce, maintain and exacerbate systemic inequities in mental health. Policymakers should consider the mental health impact of immigration policies, as they can impact not only prospective immigrants or people without leave to remain, but also those who are already settled legally in the country, and thus they should design them to minimise all harms including mental health inequalities. And appropriate statistical modelling and analysis can help uncover all this and improve decision-making and governmental action based on evidence."

    "text": "The Department of Statistical Science at UCL has a reputation for excellent teaching, and in no small part this is down to having enthusiastic academic staff who enjoy training the next generation of statisticians. Many of us have been lucky enough to attend and present at international specialist conferences on teaching statistics, including in Argentina, Australia, Canada and Japan. We bring back what we learn from attending these conferences to UCL, including fruitful connections with educators from other institutions.\nHeading to international conferences is often impractical. Though we have UK-based conferences such as Burwalls (teaching statistics to medical and allied health sciences) and CETL-MSOR (teaching maths, stats and operational research), we’re missing a specialist conference on Teaching Statistics in the UK emulating the set-ups in the US and Australia. An opportunity for statistics educators to meet and present their research – without having to travel too far (!) – is sorely needed.\nThough my day job is very much at UCL, I also chair the Royal Statistical Society’s Teaching Statistics Section. I’m very excited that we are organizing the first UK Conference on Teaching Statistics, affectionally known as UKCOTS. Our first conference will be held at The University of Manchester on the 13-14th June 2024.\nWe’ve been amazed by the amount of interest that UKCOTS has already generated, in terms of the number of abstracts for presentations we received but also those who have offered their encouragement in putting together the conference. We are lucky to have the support of the Teaching Statistics journal, who will publish a special edition to showcase the best of statistics education research that was presented at the conference.\nThere will therefore be an emphasis on statistics education research at the first UKCOTS. The conference programme with include a plenary session that will gather experienced researchers in statistics education, with a variety of other sessions dedicated to developing researchers scheduled throughout the conference.\nEveryone is welcome at UKCOTS, whether you teach statistics to specialist or non-specialist students, whether you’re highly experienced or just starting out, and whether your interest is in teaching in Higher Education, professional training, or statistical literacy in the general population. We hope to see you there in June!"

(b)：Absolute error of multilevel Monte Carlo estimates and multilevel Bayesian quadrature estimates for the integral estimation of tsunami example.\nFigure 1 illustrates an example of tsunamis. Scientists modelling such landslide-generated tsunamis must solve a complex system of differential equations describing wave evolution. In this context, designers of tsunami-resistant buildings and prevention structures might be interested in estimating quantities that are functions of the solutions of the differential equations, such as energy flux. However, there will usually be some uncertainty associated with certain physical parameters, such as those characterising the slope or size of the landslide. This uncertainty is represented through probability distributions, necessitating the computation of the expected value of the quantities of interest.\nThe main challenge here is that, in order to obtain highly accurate estimates, standard Monte Carlo methods would require very fine time and space meshes to solve the differential equations and evaluate the integrand at a fixed high accuracy level, leading to significant costs. Furthermore, in some cases, a high-resolution simulation of tsunamis in the realistic world can take a few minutes per run, making thousands or hundreds of thousands of runs infeasible, as Monte Carlo methods require large samples.\nIn contrast, multilevel Bayesian quadrature utilises several approximations with different meshes (each corresponding to a level) and employs fewer evaluations of the expensive levels. At each accuracy level, multilevel Bayesian quadrature employs a Bayesian nonparametric method, Bayesian quadrature, to estimate the integral of increments between each two consecutive levels. With a fixed computational budget, this allows multilevel Bayesian quadrature to obtain much more accurate estimates than standard Monte Carlo methods. Multilevel Bayesian quadrature combines the advantages of multilevel Monte Carlo and Bayesian quadrature, enabling it to incorporate prior knowledge as well as utilise multifidelity models. The fast convergence property of multilevel Bayesian quadrature makes it potentially valuable in fields where complex models may be involved, such as geophysics, engineering, etc."

However, my supervisors encouraged me to submit abstract proposals to describe my simulation experiments and related applications. They told me that conferences are good opportunities to organise what I have learned about my own research and be open to new research ideas related to statistics. Conferences are not only for sharing our ideas, but also learning from others. With their and my PhD peers’ support, I was able to prepare my poster and practice my oral presentation by doing a mock presentation in front of them.\nIn Sheffield, one of the researchers described that she is facing similar problems in her current statistical analysis and found my approach interesting in front of my poster. She took a picture of my poster and even thought that my work had already been published. A few other people also told me that they found the topics important and were happy that there were research activities about it. In Thessaloniki, a few researchers came to me and told me that my presentation was a nice one. I also talked to researchers who worked on similar topics to solve slightly different problems, as well as researchers who worked in the same field but with slightly different methodological interests. I got to learn about other ongoing research through posters, oral presentations and talking with other researchers.\nThese experiences helped me to become confident about my research and communication skills. They also affirmed me that getting into research as a PhD student is the right life decision for me at this stage. I am excited about exploring new research ideas that I came up with during the conferences for my PhD in the coming months!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This summer I went to MCQMC 2024 which was hosted at Waterloo University in Canada. ‘MCQMC’ stands for ‘Monte Carlo and Quasi Monte Carlo’. In statistics theorems known as Laws of Large Numbers say that, under some basic assumptions, taking increasingly large averages over independent and identically distributed (IID) samples give us better and better approximations of expectations. This is the practice of Monte Carlo. Quasi Monte Carlo replaces the IID samples with arrays of points known as `Low Discrepancy Sequences’ which can, under certain conditions, make a vast improvement over basic Monte Carlo approximation. I work in sampling, and so I applied and was accepted to give a talk about a recent paper from me and my supervisor Dr Sam Livingstone.\nI arrived at Waterloo after a 21 hour journey, and so I was feeling fairly shaky, although luckily I had a couple of days before the conference started to compose myself and write my talk. The university grounds are intermingled with parklands and streams giving the whole place a `nature wonderland’ feel. In my sojourn I saw rabbits, squirrels (black and brown), cardinal birds, stoats, groundhogs, beavers, and a few other creatures which I couldn’t identify. The university is particular in that the undergraduates spend half the term time working in normal jobs (called co-ops) and half the time studying. It is renowned for the strength of its Maths and Computer Science departments.\nThe MC/QMC community is seemingly very friendly, and so I felt welcome to give a talk which was not entirely about either Monte Carlo or Quasi Monte Carlo. Having said this, I did adjust the talk to be a more general overview of the subject the paper examines in a particular scenario. The paper looks at a common practice in sampling called `preconditioning’ whereby we transform a problem we’re trying to solve into an easier problem, solve the easier problem, and then transform the solution back. This is a very general practice and is undertaken in numerical linear algebra and convex optimisation, and so my general overview was aided with examples and intuition from these subjects. Preconditioning in sampling is comparatively understudied, which was one of the motivations for our paper, since despite the lack of theory it is still fairly widely practised. The slides can be found here and the paper here.\nAs well as giving a talk, I also attended a talk by one of my collaborators, Dr Florian Maire, who was presenting an algorithm we had devised over the past few months. Even though we have been working closely, Florian offered some new theoretical insights in the talk, which I hadn’t thought of. The algorithm sits on top of a normal sampling algorithm, and works in parallel to replace the samples from the normal algorithm with ones of higher quality. We’ll upload the paper to the arXiv soon, so keep your eyes peeled!"

    "text": "The EuroCIM is a conference primarily for researchers in causal inference, covering both applications and development of new methods. The conference consists mainly of poster and oral presentations, preceded by tutorials (which are essentially longer, more comprehensive oral presentations). With an audience whose research interests overlap significantly with mine, I’ve received some deeply insightful questions and feedback regarding my poster presentation and by extension our upcoming journal paper based on the poster that was presented (which systematically studies conditions for causal discovery algorithms to work). During the tutorials, I even received research ideas on how to proceed with (salvage) an old abandoned research project!\nOn the penultimate day of the conference, we went to a Michelin Star restaurant, and had a three course conference dinner (which we suspect is heavily subsidised since we only paid £50). The conference seating is allocated randomly, which I think is a nice touch allowing for researchers from PhD to distinguished professors to interact. I’ve even met my supervisor’s supervisor (my academic grandpa, if you will) and sent him my supervisor’s regards.\nThree months later, after braving the rebuttal process and getting our conference paper (about a causal discovery algorithm relaxing the faithfulness condition) accepted as a poster presentation, my supervisor and I attended the UAI conference. The conference covers mainly methods and theory in AI, with a substantial portion of the conference dedicated to causal inference this year. There were some familiar faces from previous conferences I’ve attended, and they provided some detailed feedback and enquiries about our poster presentation. With the conference venue right next to Barceloneta beach, and being in Barcelona during the summer, we just couldn’t resist and went there a few times after a long day at the conference. My supervisor and I even went to have drinks with other conference participants.\nBeyond discussing research technicalities, I also obtained other ‘soft’ insights from conferences, like what is it like working in Academia, and how to keep motivated during research, how academia and industry interplay etc, which will definitely help me navigate my career post PhD."

    "text": "This hands-on event brought together health economists, statisticians, and R users for small group projects aimed at developing innovative health economics tools, along with training in relevant data science skills. The hackathon was generously funded by the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS) as part of their EPSRC Strategic Workshops initiative. A hackathon is an event where participants can learn, build, and share their code in a relaxed, collaborative environment. This particular event offered a unique opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals, listen to expert speakers, and explore creative solutions to challenges in health economics. Skill sessions covered unit testing, version control with Git and GitHub, and package creation in R. One standout output from the hackathon was the development of HERA (Health Economics R Packages for All), a website that serves as a repository of open-source health economics R packages available on GitHub, complete with reliability metrics. The event was both enjoyable and provided participants with valuable new skills and knowledge to apply in their own work and teams. Plans are already underway for #htahack2025!"

    "text": "Our Head of Department has written a statement in support of this initiative:\n“This is an extremely timely proposal to challenge the legacy of eugenics, as there are benefits of a changing societal perspective to give this work credibility and power that previously was not possible to have.\nIt is important that these challenges come from our Statistical Science department specifically, because it was here that eugenics was developed originally. In addition, in conversation with colleagues at other UK institutions, it appears that the whole statistical community does not have a full grasp of our discipline’s role in this particular context. The legacy is still intertwined with much of the subject as it is taught today and many aspects of new technology connected to the subject also have added eugenics baggage. Key examples are represented by problems associated with discrimination bias in human data processing, e.g. in “frisk-and-search” policies, or facial/imaging reconstruction.\nStudent-led activities to bring about changes to the eugenics legacy are the most empowering. In my view, Stephanie’s proposal has certainly the potential to help the students effectively become the teachers and thus learn while they are in fact leading in the process.\nWith this continuation project, which is one of the departmental strategic priorities, within our EDI activities, the brief given to students will be to create an Online Open Access Course about eugenics. A facilitator will act as a support, but the content is designed by students. The course will be available long term and will be a lasting change outcome of the ChangeMakers process. The course will provide wide outreach. The output will be publicly available, contributing to the wider understanding of the underlying phenomenon.\nGianluca Baio, Professor of Statistics and Health Economics”\nIf you are a student in the Statistical Science department and you want to get involved, please sign up here:\nIf you are interested but do not want the commitment of regularly attending workshops, please be aware that we will be running a half way feedback event during Term 2 which will be a very social and fun event with cake, where we will invite (anonymous, via Menti) feedback from Statistical Science students and staff about the course development progress."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Many of Stone’s publications are remarkable for their deep impact in theoretical and applied statistics, and more recently in science in general, and data science in particular. I would like to comment on his pioneer paper Stone M (1974) Cross–Validatory Choice and Assessment of Statistical Predictions. JRSS-B, 36: 111-147 (referred hereafter as S74) which was a discussion paper read in the RSS on December 1973 and published a little more than half a century ago, in January 1974. There were 13 discussants and their questions and Stone’s replies are of very high quality.\nS74 formalises cross-validation (CV) methods; in particular, the leave-one-out cross validation procedure is firstly defined there. The paper also deals with generalising estimates of prediction errors. The paper starts with an erudite Introduction providing the historical context in which CV developed. Stone refers to his preference of the concept of assessment of statistical predictions as opposed to validation, which ‘has a ring of excessive confidence around it’, a semantic distinction which should be borne in mind but seldom is. Besides the originality of the ideas defined and developed the paper has a didactic style. In section 2 there are numerous theoretical examples further to general statements. This is followed by a section looking at well-known statistical problems, e.g. predicting the location of a single univariate sample, predictors for the the k-group problem, and the choice of variables for least-squares prediction in which a ‘cross-validatory assessment measure’ is defined. These examples are defined and analysed in detail through the lens of the methods outlined in the previous section and are then applied to real data. The last section discusses the relation of previous work on CV to the paper’s methods, presents a portrait of “a conventional paradigm for a large portion of statistical activity including a deviation to consider how the Bayesian paradigm might be accomodated in this scheme, and concudes with a series of quotations addressing philosophical and practical statistical issues.\nThere is no substitute to reading the paper to realise its elegance and usefulness but a quick way to demonstrate its growing importance over 50+ years is to look at its number of citations and the journals in which papers citing S74 have been published. I looked at data on such papers obtained from Web of Science (WoS), which claims to be “the world’s most trusted publisher-independent global citation database”; citations figures were downloaded on 2nd November 2024 and are shown against year of publication in Figure 1. Note that the last point in the Figure does not refer to the definite number of citations for 2024. Table 1 shows the journals with the largest number of papers citing S74. There is a clear shift from S74 being cited in the statistical methods literature to specialised scientific publications, notably in chemometrics, and more recently to being referenced in general science journals. This process is similar to the three principles of translational medicine: benchside, bedside, and community. This arc from basic science to generalised scientific practice has been experienced by other important statistical papers, notably by David Cox’s 1972 paper on the proportional hazards model whose remarkable trend in number of citations can be seen here.\nMervyn Stone played an important role in UCL, and his contributions to the theory and application of statistical methods continue to be increasingly useful in many scientific areas. I hope this short paper draws attention to his life and work."
