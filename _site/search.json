    "text": "I am very excited to introduce the second issue of the departmental magazine in my relatively new role as head of the department — I’ve taken over from Richard in September 2021 (you can read some sassy details of the transition in this issue). You may judge me if I say this out loud, but I was and still am very excited and proud to become the head of the department where, essentially, I have spent my entire adult career!\nThe last two years have been incredibly complicated for everyone and our community has certainly been no exception — I think we owe my predecessor a great debt of gratitude for all of his hard work, as we navigated through the Covid years. All of us had to come to terms with a different way of living and working, including amusing hours of home-schooling the children, while converting all our lecture slides into html formats and figuring out how to deliver an online lecture while ensuring that at least one of the students was still awake by the end of it… It goes without saying, but I will nonetheless say thank you to all our amazing staff, who have gone beyond the call of duty. And of course, to all our students who had to live through the most absurd university experience. In this issue, we’ve collected some testimonies both from our staff and our students, as well as reported on some important work related to the pandemic emergency.\nBehind the scenes, a lot has been going on in the department (including some modern day testing experiments): in particular, we have continued our trajectory of sustained growth in our staff and the last two years have seen a significant intake of exciting new colleagues. I am particularly pleased of the fantastic group of what one may call “Early Career Researchers” that we have managed to attract in the past few years — some of our new colleagues introduce themselves in this issue. Their work has contributed to revive the vibrant environment in the department and expand the breadth of research themes and excellence in our community, including our amazing PhD students.\nSpeaking of research, I am also pleased to report that our results for the Research Excellence Framework (REF) exercise have been positive — our submission is joint with our cousins in Mathematics. We have improved on several metrics, including research impact and we have ranked 5th on “4/3” (which is an overall measure of world-leading and internationally excellent research). We now rank 8th for “research power” (a measure of research quality, weighted by the number of staff returned) and we are very close to the institutions sitting immediately above us in this metric. Personally, I think that we are still on a journey and we haven’t fully reaped the fruits of our investments in human resources and that the next one will be the REF in which we graduate to top 5 — I hope that we will continue to establish further our community and the sense of belonging for all our staff and students.\nIn the time since the last issue of Sample Space, we have also worked hard to establish a presence on several social medial channels: we now have a quite vibrant Twitter account and are active on Instagram and LinkedIn. This may sound unnecessarily chirpy and hipster, but I think these have already been very good media to generate discussion and showcase many of the activities that go on in the department (including the brilliant widening participation effort of Data Detectives, described here) and so am personally pleased that we have started developing them — for which I definitely need to thank our “Social Media Team” of Sam Livinstone, Javier Rubio, Brieuc Lehmann and Audrey Gbato. And: we’ve also started our podcast series (aptly named “Random Talks”), thanks to the brilliant work of Sam, Terry Soo, Nathan Green and Brieuc, who have already produced some super-interesting episodes, including one where Tom Fearn tells about his experience sitting on the UCL eugenics inquiry, which is also presented in this issue."

    "text": "The Athena SWAN Charter aims to promote gender equality within science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine throughout the UK and beyond. The department’s equality and diversity committee, chaired by Alex Donov and Niloufar Abourashchi, meets regularly and works to ensure that the principles of the charter are upheld.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring my first meeting with Alex Donov, he explained that at UCL Statistics, there are roughly equal proportions of men and women across the BSc and MSc levels. However, from the PhD level onwards, there is an imbalance: the proportion of male students is larger.\nTo find out more about this imbalance, surveys were conducted among groups of students in the department. I was responsible for the processing and analysis of a survey conducted among a cohort of MSc students at the end of their course. The main tasks were filing the paper survey answers into an electronic data set and analysing this data set. The analysis mainly consisted of trying out different techniques to visualise the data as clearly as possible. In the next Athena SWAN meeting, I will present the results from this analysis.\nSo far, I have really enjoyed working on the project. It feels as if the work is appreciated and I was given real responsibility, which is very motivating. I have learned a lot in the process, partly because of useful feedback on my work and partly because it was a nice challenge to rise to. I hope to contribute some ideas based on the data in the upcoming months.\nLook out for Doranne’s results in a future edition of Sample Space.\n\nThe Numbers Game\nUCL has long been at the forefront of promoting women within mathematical sciences.\nTwenty-five years ago, the department initiated a Celebrating Women in Mathematics day, aimed at encouraging aspiring female mathematicians to study at UCL. With the ongoing commitment of staff and students, this event has run almost every year since, and is now a firmly established annual departmental event.\nPast events, including Celebrating Women in Mathematics, have attracted audiences numbering over 300. And the cross-departmental meeting series UCL Women in Mathematical Sciences, which organises several events per year, is also highly subscribed.\nThe IMSS will enable us to increase our engagement with groups that are under-represented within the discipline, and ensure that UK mathematical science attracts talent that is as diverse as possible."

This year, we’re excited to announce a major change to the way UCL approaches teaching and research in the fields of Mathematics and Statistical Science.

The Department of Statistical Science, founded in 1911, was the first statistics department to be established anywhere in the world.\nThe UCL of the future will remain radical and continue to encourage disruptive thinking, increasingly breaking down traditional barriers of faculty and discipline – which is exactly why the new IMSS will be greater than the sum of its parts.\nIt aims to be London’s leading centre for research, teaching and collaboration in mathematics and statistics, establishing UCL as a global leader, and creating an outward-looking centre for the mathematical sciences and its applications."

It’s also a vast and evolving discipline, and with more research staff interacting with other UCL departments and visiting scholars, the IMSS will allow us to cover most of its research areas.\nWe’ve seen the power of joint research across many of our other departments, and bringing great minds together will lead to fundamental breakthroughs across disciplines. The IMSS wants to create an atmosphere of lively research collaboration between mathematical sciences and other departments across UCL.\nWith a concentration of around 135 academic and teaching staff, from early career professionals to established world-leading researchers, the IMSS will support a thriving community of students who will get to experience cross-disciplinary interaction everyday. We will recruit and nurture outstanding mathematicians and statisticians, and provide an environment in which they can flourish and contribute to wider society. Beyond UCL, the IMSS will fully exploit its central London location by strengthening interactions with institutions like the Alan Turing Institute, the Francis Crick Institute, GCHQ, London’s financial industry and government departments. It will also be internationally accessible, with facilities and a forward-thinking events programme to bring our research to the wider world. We aim to host national and international meetings, conferences and workshops in the mathematical sciences, with involvement from learned societies in our disciplines."

Here, Hideki Itabashi and Hannah Summers tell us their stories from the 2018/19 academic year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHideki Itabashi\nFor my exchange, I studied at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, upstate New York, USA, taking classes in Data Analytics, Probability and Information Design.\nFor my Data Analytics project in R, I looked at ‘Reasons Behind Human Migration in the EU’. I predicted the number of incoming migrants for each EU state in 2017, based on historical socio-economic, education, healthcare and welfare data that I gathered and sorted from the UN, Eurostat and OECD Statistics. The workload was definitely more than what I was used to at UCL, since weekly assignments and midterms grades were emphasised alongside the final exam. I definitely recommend taking project-based classes for students who are looking to travel around.\nOutside of academics, I travelled to cities along the West and East Coasts of the US, plus Toronto, Montréal and Cancun. Although I was only there for two terms, I was fortunate enough to be able to pledge a fraternity and compete nationally with the rugby squad. For those in the first and second year, studying abroad as part of the MSci International Programme is something I’d definitely recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nHannah Summers\nSnow. Squirrels. Study. The three pillars to my eight-month venture into the world of University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.\nWith six months below zero degrees celsius, and Christmas spent on the Great Lakes, the experience was unlike any I have had before. Days were spent watching the squirrels (both brown and black) through my window whilst I studied, exploring the local craft beers and visiting nearby lakes.\nI studied a wide variety of topics from function estimation, to group theory, to classification, to the epistemology of ignorance. And I undertook national data science competitions whilst investigating the connection between the herb valerian and insomnia. I had the opportunity to experience refreshingly different styles of teaching and explore new areas of learning, in particular a fascinating look at the world of data visualisation.\nWaterloo was the perfect balance of the known (the language, studying, coffee) and the unknown (the people, food and the arrival of the geese). The year was a beautiful adventure filled with many a FaceTime chat, the best burgers, and perfect crisp blue mornings. I look forward to one day returning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents who are interested in participating in the Erasmus programme can find out more by visiting: www.ucl.ac.uk/students/go-abroad/study-abroad-and-erasmus."

    "text": "Mete Veyisoglu spent a year studying MSc Data Science at UCL in 2018/19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I decided to apply for UCL’s MSc in Data Science, I had been working at Koc University (Istanbul, Turkey) as institutional planning manager for five years. My duties comprised various data-related tasks such as forecasting, financial planning and data-driven decision-making to shape future strategy. I had huge amounts of academic data at my disposal, and I had to be both creative in coming up with various statistics to depict the institution’s outlook and also very careful not to make any scientific errors as it would lead to incorrect decisions.\nIn short, I needed more expertise in the fields of statistics and machine learning. I chose UCL for its strong tradition in statistics (this was a pioneering statistics department, where many of the founders of the discipline worked), its historic Bloomsbury location that is very central but also pleasantly remote from the busy tourist and commuter crowds, and its general reputation as one of the best universities in the world.\nI had to decide between two programmes, MSc in Data Science offered by the Statistics department and MSc in Data Science and Machine Learning offered by the Computer Science department. I chose the first one mainly because I am more oriented towards mathematics and statistics, and I wanted to learn about the classical fundamentals. As the probabilist and risk guru Nassim Nicholas Taleb says in his bestseller ‘Skin In The Game’: “No statistics without logic, no mathematics without proof, no facts without rigor”. Today, the amount of data available in any domain is huge and it is very easy to mistake noise for signal and find interesting but misleading patterns in data. I was hoping to gain the skills to identify these pitfalls.\nReality usually falls short of meeting our expectations, but my year in the Statistics department was an exception to this rule. Not only did I see that all my reasons for choosing UCL and the Data Science programme proved to be correct, but I also found that my classmates were brilliant people. I learned as much from them as I did from the classes.\nOne huge advantage of the programme is that it’s cross-disciplinary, so we had colleagues from a variety of backgrounds such as mathematics, physics, economics and engineering. This made the postgraduate study room a great place to learn from each other. Also, UCL and the Statistics department are doing a great job of listening to students. Faculty members, MSc tutors and administrative management genuinely work towards finding solutions to student-reported issues. This determination to resolve issues, in turn, increased my motivation to learn.\nIn the fall and spring terms, I took very interesting modules including Introduction to Machine Learning, Introduction to Statistical Data Science, Financial Data and Statistics, Extreme Value Theory, and Copula Theory, among others. I loved the system in the UK where you take all the year’s exams in May, so you are not ‘done’ with the fall semester modules in December. This is a good way to ensure that students learn for life, not just for school.\nThe summer term was dedicated to the research project, and it was both challenging and fun. I chose to work on an issue related to my job at Koc University: using statistical and machine learning methods to predict which college students are more likely to fail and eventually drop out of college. I think I worked harder in summer than in either of the other terms – it’s really challenging to deliver a UCL-level MSc dissertation in three months! Nevertheless, I loved the challenge of working on a longer-term project, making small steps of progress every day. I had weekly meetings with my supervisor, Dr. Thomas Honnor, who was very supportive and helped me keep my stamina and my motivation up through summer. In the end, we both were very content with the resulting work. The models that I developed will have huge practical value for Koc University, and the thesis could even serve as a model on how to use data science to increase data-driven policy-making in Turkish Higher Education.\nThe quantitative skills I gained and the brilliant people I met during my year at UCL indicate that this was not a chapter you close and move on from; but one that will always guide you through your career. I am certain that my classmates feel the same.\nLook out for more student stories in future editions of Sample Space."

    "text": "Professor Serge Guillas is leading a team seeking better ways to predict potentially disastrous tsunamis using high-performance computing… \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently, major tsunamis in Indonesia and Japan have caused the insurance industry and civil authorities around the world to demand better models to assess tsunami risk. In particular, the economic impacts of the tsunamis include losses of livelihoods and incomes, loss of boats and gear among fishing communities, and increased levels of poverty in the aftermath of the event.\nTo model tsunami waves and currents, and their uncertainties, UCL’s research group of PhD students, postdocs, and research software engineers is making use of high-performance computing (HPC).\nProf Guillas is leading several projects to improve both long-term risk assessments and short-term warnings using HPC and modern statistical methods:\nUQM3: ‘Uncertainty Quantification Of Multi-scale And Multi-physics Computer Models: Applications To Hazard And Climate’ in collaboration with the Universities of Oxford, Warwick and Exeter. Running from 01/10/2018 – 30/09/2020.\nThis project aims to answer some of the questions around natural events, such as tsunamis, earthquakes or climate changes, by quantifying the uncertainties in complex simulators.\nUncertainty Quantification uses surrogate models that allow the uncertainties to be modelled more efficiently. However, designing a workflow that integrates models as diverse as natural phenomena is a challenge.\nWhen applied to natural events, it’s hoped that Uncertainty Quantification will help us carry out risk assessments around the impact of earthquakes or tsunamis, for example. This will help us understand how to build resilient infrastructure and protect populations.\nUQM3’s research is carried out at the Alan Turing Institute - the national institute for data science and artificial intelligence - with headquarters at the British Library. It’s part of the Data-centric Engineering (DCE) programme of the Turing.\nRADDISH: ‘Real-Time Advanced Data Assimilation for Digital Simulation of Numerical Twins on HPC’, funded by the Strategic Priorities Fund, EPSRC AI for Science and Government. Running from 01/08/2019 – 31/07/2020.\nBased at the Turing Institute, RADDISH is implementing agent-based models to facilitate tsunami warnings and evacuation modelling.\nUsing high performance computers, a digital twin of a tsunami event can track actions in real-time using live data. We can accurately monitor how an event would unfold and identify areas where changes can be made to procedure to improve the safety of those involved.\nVETII: ‘Vessels Evacuation from Tsunamis in India and Indonesia’, funded by the Grand Challenge Research Fund (GCRF). Running from 01/01/2020 – 30/06/2020.\nVETII uses accurate agent-based models of vessels in ports around India and Indonesia and applies probabilistic tsunami current hazard assessments to simulated models.\nWe can apply different scenarios to these models to see how quickly people can evacuate when a tsunami occurs, ultimately creating the most efficient layout for boats in different ports.\nFITTER: ‘Future Indonesian Tsunamis: Towards End-to-end Risk Quantification’ funded by the Lloyd’s Tercentenary Research Foundation, the Lighthill Risk Network and the Lloyd’s Register Foundation. Running from 2019 – 2022.\nFITTER will focus on the risk of a tsunami hitting areas of important infrastructure. We will produce stochastic tsunami hazard footprints, new vulnerability functions for the resilience of infrastructure such as ports, and for the livelihood of populations. This open model will be of use to both Government and the insurance industry, and enable modern disaster risk financing for Indonesia.\n‘Uncertainty Quantification for Tsunamis’ on the Cambridge Service for Data Driven Discovery (CSD3) facility, EPSRC tier 2 HPC. Running from 01/10/2018 – 30/09/2022.\nIn this project, we’re assessing tsunami simulations on the UK’s largest graphical processing unit (GPU) cluster. This means we can use Uncertainty Quantification to predict the complex nature of tsunamis with more accuracy and detail.\nEarly warnings using satellites Running from 2019 – 2023.\nIn collaboration with the University of Shizuoka (Japan), and with UCL PhD student Ryuichi Kanai funded by the Japan Student Services Organization, we aim to collect signals within minutes of the tsunami from the ionosphere through GPS satellites.\nAGITHAR Prof Guillas is also UK representative and Chair of the Working group on Uncertainties, in the COST action ‘Accelerating Global Science in Tsunami Hazard and Risk Analysis’ (2019-2023, 25 countries). This network will improve, standardise, and promote tsunami research.\nYou can find the latest developments in Professor Guillas’ research by visiting: https://www.turing.ac.uk.\n\nImpact on populations: Prof Guillas visited the region of Mumbai, India, in 2018 and 2019, to engage with the fishermen community. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has been facilitating our disaster resilience project in the region."

The event was organised by the department’s Teaching Fellows, with the aim of bringing together those who teach statistics in higher education to hear about, and discuss, exciting developments in the field. Over 60 people from around the UK attended and took part in a number of lively debates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first session focused on teaching non-statisticians and featured contributions from Margaret MacDougall (University of Edinburgh), who discussed the statistics that medical students need to learn and how they might retain that knowledge in the long term, and Charalampos Chanialidis (University of Glasgow), who described how an online MSc in Data Analytics was established and implemented. Virtual learning and approaches to teaching non-statisticians both provoked interesting discussion.\nAfter lunch we concentrated on teaching statisticians. Elke Thonnes (University of Warwick) considered authentic learning which provides useful data-centric skills for students including statistical consultancy, and then Paul Northrop (UCL) talked about a research-based learning initiative wherein undergraduates read an academic paper, discuss it with the author and then summarise their findings. Both included a section on group assessment which was clearly of interest to many present.\nThe symposium concluded with a panel discussion on the future of teaching statistics. Panel members included Rachel Hilliam from the Open University, Andy Field from the University of Sussex (who is known for his cartoon-based books on statistics), and Sharon Witherspoon, the Royal Statistical Society’s Vice President for Education and Statistical Literacy. The discussion encompassed subjects such as data science, the use of statistical software, short courses for professionals and remote teaching. These topics exemplified the diversity of approaches that will inevitably proliferate over the coming years.\nThe symposium was followed by the launch of the RSS Special Interest Group on Teaching Statistics, chaired by Elinor Jones (UCL)."

We wanted the students to witness first-hand how diverse statistics as a subject actually is, and in doing so we were hoping to show them that statistics at university is a lot more interesting than what they do in school! They learnt some R with Elinor Jones and were able to use their new-found skills to build models with Tom Fearn.\nOther highlights included learning about forensic statistics with Ardo Van den Hout, trying out some maths with Sam Livingstone, and discussing risk and disaster statistics with Katerina Stavrianaki. They even had a morning discussing statistics and crop genetics with Michael Scott – a researcher from the Division of Biosciences at UCL – who gave them a primer on genetics before showing how statistics is used in crop research.\nFor some of the students, the highlight was spending a morning at the Turing Institute with Franz Kiraly. The Turing Institute, which is housed at the British Library on Euston Road, is a very inspiring space. There they spent the morning discussing data science, and the students certainly returned to the Department of Statistical Science with even more enthusiasm for learning statistics.\nWe certainly changed the students’ minds about statistics by the end of the week – they all agreed that statistics was far more interesting than they ever thought possible. Intriguingly, they commented that statistics as a subject was completely different to what they perceived it to be. It’s encouraging that most of the students ended the week keen to study at least some statistics at university.\nWe’re looking forward to showing more school students just how great studying statistics can be, and why it’s so important to be statistically literate."
