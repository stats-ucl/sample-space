    "text": "I am very excited to introduce the second issue of the departmental magazine in my relatively new role as head of the department — I’ve taken over from Richard in September 2021 (you can read some sassy details of the transition in this issue). You may judge me if I say this out loud, but I was and still am very excited and proud to become the head of the department where, essentially, I have spent my entire adult career!\nThe last two years have been incredibly complicated for everyone and our community has certainly been no exception — I think we owe my predecessor a great debt of gratitude for all of his hard work, as we navigated through the Covid years. All of us had to come to terms with a different way of living and working, including amusing hours of home-schooling the children, while converting all our lecture slides into html formats and figuring out how to deliver an online lecture while ensuring that at least one of the students was still awake by the end of it… It goes without saying, but I will nonetheless say thank you to all our amazing staff, who have gone beyond the call of duty. And of course, to all our students who had to live through the most absurd university experience. In this issue, we’ve collected some testimonies both from our staff and our students, as well as reported on some important work related to the pandemic emergency.\nBehind the scenes, a lot has been going on in the department (including some modern day testing experiments): in particular, we have continued our trajectory of sustained growth in our staff and the last two years have seen a significant intake of exciting new colleagues. I am particularly pleased of the fantastic group of what one may call “Early Career Researchers” that we have managed to attract in the past few years — some of our new colleagues introduce themselves in this issue. Their work has contributed to revive the vibrant environment in the department and expand the breadth of research themes and excellence in our community, including our amazing PhD students.\nSpeaking of research, I am also pleased to report that our results for the Research Excellence Framework (REF) exercise have been positive — our submission is joint with our cousins in Mathematics. We have improved on several metrics, including research impact and we have ranked 5th on “4/3” (which is an overall measure of world-leading and internationally excellent research). We now rank 8th for “research power” (a measure of research quality, weighted by the number of staff returned) and we are very close to the institutions sitting immediately above us in this metric. Personally, I think that we are still on a journey and we haven’t fully reaped the fruits of our investments in human resources and that the next one will be the REF in which we graduate to top 5 — I hope that we will continue to establish further our community and the sense of belonging for all our staff and students.\nIn the time since the last issue of Sample Space, we have also worked hard to establish a presence on several social medial channels: we now have a quite vibrant Twitter account and are active on Instagram and LinkedIn. This may sound unnecessarily chirpy and hipster, but I think these have already been very good media to generate discussion and showcase many of the activities that go on in the department (including the brilliant widening participation effort of Data Detectives, described here) and so am personally pleased that we have started developing them — for which I definitely need to thank our “Social Media Team” of Sam Livinstone, Javier Rubio, Brieuc Lehmann and Audrey Gbato. And: we’ve also started our podcast series (aptly named “Random Talks”), thanks to the brilliant work of Sam, Terry Soo, Nathan Green and Brieuc, who have already produced some super-interesting episodes, including one where Tom Fearn tells about his experience sitting on the UCL eugenics inquiry, which is also presented in this issue."

    "text": "The Athena SWAN Charter aims to promote gender equality within science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine throughout the UK and beyond. The department’s equality and diversity committee, chaired by Alex Donov and Niloufar Abourashchi, meets regularly and works to ensure that the principles of the charter are upheld.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring my first meeting with Alex Donov, he explained that at UCL Statistics, there are roughly equal proportions of men and women across the BSc and MSc levels. However, from the PhD level onwards, there is an imbalance: the proportion of male students is larger.\nTo find out more about this imbalance, surveys were conducted among groups of students in the department. I was responsible for the processing and analysis of a survey conducted among a cohort of MSc students at the end of their course. The main tasks were filing the paper survey answers into an electronic data set and analysing this data set. The analysis mainly consisted of trying out different techniques to visualise the data as clearly as possible. In the next Athena SWAN meeting, I will present the results from this analysis.\nSo far, I have really enjoyed working on the project. It feels as if the work is appreciated and I was given real responsibility, which is very motivating. I have learned a lot in the process, partly because of useful feedback on my work and partly because it was a nice challenge to rise to. I hope to contribute some ideas based on the data in the upcoming months.\nLook out for Doranne’s results in a future edition of Sample Space.\n\n\nThe Numbers Game\nUCL has long been at the forefront of promoting women within mathematical sciences.\nTwenty-five years ago, the department initiated a Celebrating Women in Mathematics day, aimed at encouraging aspiring female mathematicians to study at UCL. With the ongoing commitment of staff and students, this event has run almost every year since, and is now a firmly established annual departmental event.\nPast events, including Celebrating Women in Mathematics, have attracted audiences numbering over 300. And the cross-departmental meeting series UCL Women in Mathematical Sciences, which organises several events per year, is also highly subscribed.\nThe IMSS will enable us to increase our engagement with groups that are under-represented within the discipline, and ensure that UK mathematical science attracts talent that is as diverse as possible."

Drivers were placed randomly into two groups, and after some practice runs received average lap times for the circuit. They were then sorted into two groups based on average times, and this time raced in groups, with first, second and third place medals on offer. Shenanigans ensued that wouldn’t be out of place in an episode of classic TV show ‘Wacky Races’!\nThe podium finishers of the A race were Giampiero Marra, Johnny Picken and Marcel Hirt, and the B race honours went to Samuel Livingstone, Niloufar Abourashchi and Ioanna Manolopoulou. An extra special mention also goes to Marcel Hirt who managed the fastest single lap of the day at a frighteningly quick 48 seconds!"

This year, we’re excited to announce a major change to the way UCL approaches teaching and research in the fields of Mathematics and Statistical Science. We’re pooling, collocating and expanding these departments to create the Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Sciences (IMSS) and bring UCL into the top 20 institutions globally for mathematical sciences."

Here, Hideki Itabashi and Hannah Summers tell us their stories from the 2018/19 academic year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHideki Itabashi\nFor my exchange, I studied at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, upstate New York, USA, taking classes in Data Analytics, Probability and Information Design.\nFor my Data Analytics project in R, I looked at ‘Reasons Behind Human Migration in the EU’. I predicted the number of incoming migrants for each EU state in 2017, based on historical socio-economic, education, healthcare and welfare data that I gathered and sorted from the UN, Eurostat and OECD Statistics. The workload was definitely more than what I was used to at UCL, since weekly assignments and midterms grades were emphasised alongside the final exam. I definitely recommend taking project-based classes for students who are looking to travel around.\nOutside of academics, I travelled to cities along the West and East Coasts of the US, plus Toronto, Montréal and Cancun. Although I was only there for two terms, I was fortunate enough to be able to pledge a fraternity and compete nationally with the rugby squad. For those in the first and second year, studying abroad as part of the MSci International Programme is something I’d definitely recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nHannah Summers\nSnow. Squirrels. Study. The three pillars to my eight-month venture into the world of University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.\nWith six months below zero degrees celsius, and Christmas spent on the Great Lakes, the experience was unlike any I have had before. Days were spent watching the squirrels (both brown and black) through my window whilst I studied, exploring the local craft beers and visiting nearby lakes.\nI studied a wide variety of topics from function estimation, to group theory, to classification, to the epistemology of ignorance. And I undertook national data science competitions whilst investigating the connection between the herb valerian and insomnia. I had the opportunity to experience refreshingly different styles of teaching and explore new areas of learning, in particular a fascinating look at the world of data visualisation.\nWaterloo was the perfect balance of the known (the language, studying, coffee) and the unknown (the people, food and the arrival of the geese). The year was a beautiful adventure filled with many a FaceTime chat, the best burgers, and perfect crisp blue mornings. I look forward to one day returning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents who are interested in participating in the Erasmus programme can find out more by visiting: www.ucl.ac.uk/students/go-abroad/study-abroad-and-erasmus."

    "text": "Mete Veyisoglu spent a year studying MSc Data Science at UCL in 2018/19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I decided to apply for UCL’s MSc in Data Science, I had been working at Koc University (Istanbul, Turkey) as institutional planning manager for five years. My duties comprised various data-related tasks such as forecasting, financial planning and data-driven decision-making to shape future strategy. I had huge amounts of academic data at my disposal, and I had to be both creative in coming up with various statistics to depict the institution’s outlook and also very careful not to make any scientific errors as it would lead to incorrect decisions.\nIn short, I needed more expertise in the fields of statistics and machine learning. I chose UCL for its strong tradition in statistics (this was a pioneering statistics department, where many of the founders of the discipline worked), its historic Bloomsbury location that is very central but also pleasantly remote from the busy tourist and commuter crowds, and its general reputation as one of the best universities in the world.\nI had to decide between two programmes, MSc in Data Science offered by the Statistics department and MSc in Data Science and Machine Learning offered by the Computer Science department. I chose the first one mainly because I am more oriented towards mathematics and statistics, and I wanted to learn about the classical fundamentals. As the probabilist and risk guru Nassim Nicholas Taleb says in his bestseller ‘Skin In The Game’: “No statistics without logic, no mathematics without proof, no facts without rigor”. Today, the amount of data available in any domain is huge and it is very easy to mistake noise for signal and find interesting but misleading patterns in data. I was hoping to gain the skills to identify these pitfalls.\nReality usually falls short of meeting our expectations, but my year in the Statistics department was an exception to this rule. Not only did I see that all my reasons for choosing UCL and the Data Science programme proved to be correct, but I also found that my classmates were brilliant people. I learned as much from them as I did from the classes.\nOne huge advantage of the programme is that it’s cross-disciplinary, so we had colleagues from a variety of backgrounds such as mathematics, physics, economics and engineering. This made the postgraduate study room a great place to learn from each other. Also, UCL and the Statistics department are doing a great job of listening to students. Faculty members, MSc tutors and administrative management genuinely work towards finding solutions to student-reported issues. This determination to resolve issues, in turn, increased my motivation to learn.\nIn the fall and spring terms, I took very interesting modules including Introduction to Machine Learning, Introduction to Statistical Data Science, Financial Data and Statistics, Extreme Value Theory, and Copula Theory, among others. I loved the system in the UK where you take all the year’s exams in May, so you are not ‘done’ with the fall semester modules in December. This is a good way to ensure that students learn for life, not just for school.\nThe summer term was dedicated to the research project, and it was both challenging and fun. I chose to work on an issue related to my job at Koc University: using statistical and machine learning methods to predict which college students are more likely to fail and eventually drop out of college. I think I worked harder in summer than in either of the other terms – it’s really challenging to deliver a UCL-level MSc dissertation in three months! Nevertheless, I loved the challenge of working on a longer-term project, making small steps of progress every day. I had weekly meetings with my supervisor, Dr. Thomas Honnor, who was very supportive and helped me keep my stamina and my motivation up through summer. In the end, we both were very content with the resulting work. The models that I developed will have huge practical value for Koc University, and the thesis could even serve as a model on how to use data science to increase data-driven policy-making in Turkish Higher Education.\nThe quantitative skills I gained and the brilliant people I met during my year at UCL indicate that this was not a chapter you close and move on from; but one that will always guide you through your career. I am certain that my classmates feel the same.\nLook out for more student stories in future editions of Sample Space."

    "text": "Professor Serge Guillas is leading a team seeking better ways to predict potentially disastrous tsunamis using high-performance computing… \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently, major tsunamis in Indonesia and Japan have caused the insurance industry and civil authorities around the world to demand better models to assess tsunami risk. In particular, the economic impacts of the tsunamis include losses of livelihoods and incomes, loss of boats and gear among fishing communities, and increased levels of poverty in the aftermath of the event.\nTo model tsunami waves and currents, and their uncertainties, UCL’s research group of PhD students, postdocs, and research software engineers is making use of high-performance computing (HPC).\nProf Guillas is leading several projects to improve both long-term risk assessments and short-term warnings using HPC and modern statistical methods:\nUQM3: ‘Uncertainty Quantification Of Multi-scale And Multi-physics Computer Models: Applications To Hazard And Climate’ in collaboration with the Universities of Oxford, Warwick and Exeter. Running from 01/10/2018 – 30/09/2020.\nThis project aims to answer some of the questions around natural events, such as tsunamis, earthquakes or climate changes, by quantifying the uncertainties in complex simulators.\nUncertainty Quantification uses surrogate models that allow the uncertainties to be modelled more efficiently. However, designing a workflow that integrates models as diverse as natural phenomena is a challenge.\nWhen applied to natural events, it’s hoped that Uncertainty Quantification will help us carry out risk assessments around the impact of earthquakes or tsunamis, for example. This will help us understand how to build resilient infrastructure and protect populations.\nUQM3’s research is carried out at the Alan Turing Institute - the national institute for data science and artificial intelligence - with headquarters at the British Library. It’s part of the Data-centric Engineering (DCE) programme of the Turing.\nRADDISH: ‘Real-Time Advanced Data Assimilation for Digital Simulation of Numerical Twins on HPC’, funded by the Strategic Priorities Fund, EPSRC AI for Science and Government. Running from 01/08/2019 – 31/07/2020.\nBased at the Turing Institute, RADDISH is implementing agent-based models to facilitate tsunami warnings and evacuation modelling.\nUsing high performance computers, a digital twin of a tsunami event can track actions in real-time using live data. We can accurately monitor how an event would unfold and identify areas where changes can be made to procedure to improve the safety of those involved.\nVETII: ‘Vessels Evacuation from Tsunamis in India and Indonesia’, funded by the Grand Challenge Research Fund (GCRF). Running from 01/01/2020 – 30/06/2020.\nVETII uses accurate agent-based models of vessels in ports around India and Indonesia and applies probabilistic tsunami current hazard assessments to simulated models.\nWe can apply different scenarios to these models to see how quickly people can evacuate when a tsunami occurs, ultimately creating the most efficient layout for boats in different ports.\nFITTER: ‘Future Indonesian Tsunamis: Towards End-to-end Risk Quantification’ funded by the Lloyd’s Tercentenary Research Foundation, the Lighthill Risk Network and the Lloyd’s Register Foundation. Running from 2019 – 2022.\nFITTER will focus on the risk of a tsunami hitting areas of important infrastructure. We will produce stochastic tsunami hazard footprints, new vulnerability functions for the resilience of infrastructure such as ports, and for the livelihood of populations. This open model will be of use to both Government and the insurance industry, and enable modern disaster risk financing for Indonesia.\n‘Uncertainty Quantification for Tsunamis’ on the Cambridge Service for Data Driven Discovery (CSD3) facility, EPSRC tier 2 HPC. Running from 01/10/2018 – 30/09/2022.\nIn this project, we’re assessing tsunami simulations on the UK’s largest graphical processing unit (GPU) cluster. This means we can use Uncertainty Quantification to predict the complex nature of tsunamis with more accuracy and detail.\nEarly warnings using satellites Running from 2019 – 2023.\nIn collaboration with the University of Shizuoka (Japan), and with UCL PhD student Ryuichi Kanai funded by the Japan Student Services Organization, we aim to collect signals within minutes of the tsunami from the ionosphere through GPS satellites.\nAGITHAR Prof Guillas is also UK representative and Chair of the Working group on Uncertainties, in the COST action ‘Accelerating Global Science in Tsunami Hazard and Risk Analysis’ (2019-2023, 25 countries). This network will improve, standardise, and promote tsunami research.\nYou can find the latest developments in Professor Guillas’ research by visiting: https://www.turing.ac.uk.\n\nImpact on populations: Prof Guillas visited the region of Mumbai, India, in 2018 and 2019, to engage with the fishermen community. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has been facilitating our disaster resilience project in the region."

The event was organised by the department’s Teaching Fellows, with the aim of bringing together those who teach statistics in higher education to hear about, and discuss, exciting developments in the field. Over 60 people from around the UK attended and took part in a number of lively debates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first session focused on teaching non-statisticians and featured contributions from Margaret MacDougall (University of Edinburgh), who discussed the statistics that medical students need to learn and how they might retain that knowledge in the long term, and Charalampos Chanialidis (University of Glasgow), who described how an online MSc in Data Analytics was established and implemented. Virtual learning and approaches to teaching non-statisticians both provoked interesting discussion.\nAfter lunch we concentrated on teaching statisticians. Elke Thonnes (University of Warwick) considered authentic learning which provides useful data-centric skills for students including statistical consultancy, and then Paul Northrop (UCL) talked about a research-based learning initiative wherein undergraduates read an academic paper, discuss it with the author and then summarise their findings. Both included a section on group assessment which was clearly of interest to many present.\nThe symposium concluded with a panel discussion on the future of teaching statistics. Panel members included Rachel Hilliam from the Open University, Andy Field from the University of Sussex (who is known for his cartoon-based books on statistics), and Sharon Witherspoon, the Royal Statistical Society’s Vice President for Education and Statistical Literacy. The discussion encompassed subjects such as data science, the use of statistical software, short courses for professionals and remote teaching. These topics exemplified the diversity of approaches that will inevitably proliferate over the coming years.\nThe symposium was followed by the launch of the RSS Special Interest Group on Teaching Statistics, chaired by Elinor Jones (UCL)."

We wanted the students to witness first-hand how diverse statistics as a subject actually is, and in doing so we were hoping to show them that statistics at university is a lot more interesting than what they do in school! They learnt some R with Elinor Jones and were able to use their new-found skills to build models with Tom Fearn.\nOther highlights included learning about forensic statistics with Ardo Van den Hout, trying out some maths with Sam Livingstone, and discussing risk and disaster statistics with Katerina Stavrianaki. They even had a morning discussing statistics and crop genetics with Michael Scott – a researcher from the Division of Biosciences at UCL – who gave them a primer on genetics before showing how statistics is used in crop research.\nFor some of the students, the highlight was spending a morning at the Turing Institute with Franz Kiraly. The Turing Institute, which is housed at the British Library on Euston Road, is a very inspiring space. There they spent the morning discussing data science, and the students certainly returned to the Department of Statistical Science with even more enthusiasm for learning statistics.\nWe certainly changed the students’ minds about statistics by the end of the week – they all agreed that statistics was far more interesting than they ever thought possible. Intriguingly, they commented that statistics as a subject was completely different to what they perceived it to be. It’s encouraging that most of the students ended the week keen to study at least some statistics at university.\nWe’re looking forward to showing more school students just how great studying statistics can be, and why it’s so important to be statistically literate."

    "text": "Projects currently being undertaken by the department’s PhD students…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWenyu Wang\nThe multi-state model describes a process where individuals move among a series of states over time. It is increasingly popular in a wide range of applications in biostatistics.\nGenerally, if death is one state, the multi-state model can be seen as an extension of survival analysis. In most studies, covariate effects are fixed effects. These effects do not take into account unobserved heterogeneity with respect to individual or group level effects. In multi-state models, unobserved heterogeneity in rates of moving from one state to another is often present. In survival analysis, such an effect is called a frailty.\nMy PhD research is focusing on frailty models. For instance, exploring different distribution of frailties, defining frailties in different transitions, and multivariate frailty models. Including frailty effects helps to improve model performance under the Markov assumption. In multi-state models, we assume that the continuous-time multi-state model is a Markov process, which implies that future states are only determined by the current states. It is known that in reality the transition hazard may be affected by the time spent in previous states, implying that the future not only depends on current states but also the past, breaking the Markov assumption. For example, individuals who have spent more time in a diseased state are more likely to move towards death. This can be addressed using a frailty model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsma Saleh\nI consider Tobit models, which refer to censored or truncated regression models in which the range of the dependent variable is constrained in some way.\nFor example, a leading model used to deal with censored data is the Tobit 1 model, which is used to analyse household expenditure on durable goods against income where the expenditure cannot be negative. The main challenge with such models is that ignoring censoring will generally lead to inconsistent and biased estimators. In the example above, because the expenditure is observed only when it is positive, conventional regression methods like ordinary least squares estimators for the relationship between household expenditure and income are downwardly biased. In my PhD I consider variations of the Tobit 1 model for the general problem known as sample selection.\nThis means that observational studies are rarely based on pure random samples. Instead, a sample is based in part on values taken by a dependent variable which gives rise to sample selection bias. The most popular solution is a two-stage procedure proposed by Heckman, called the Heckit estimator, combining a probit maximum likelihood procedure and simple linear regression.\nI am investigating the performance of implicit bias reduction techniques such as the modified score equations method of Firth (1993) and the indirect inference method of Kuk (1995), through simulation and contrasting them with the standard maximum likelihood estimation and the Heckman two-step estimation procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarta Campi\nMy research focuses on non-stationary basis decomposition methods in time-frequency analysis.\nClassical methodologies in the field of time-frequency analysis rely on strong statistical assumptions that may not be valid in real data scenarios and modern applications. This work is based on a class of methods known as the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). The EMD is a non-parametric time-series decomposition technique, in which a time-series basis called the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) is extracted, which has specific statistical properties.\nThe main focus is offering a very general applicable family of basis extraction methods with relatively few requirements. This is highly important for two main reasons: firstly, more universal applications can be taken into account; secondly, the EMD has very little a priori knowledge of the process required in order to apply it.\nThe application taken into account here is related to Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) technologies. As with any biometric system, ASV is subject to spoofing attacks which mimic a target speaker’s voice in person or remotely via artificial tools. The EMD is employed to extract features of speech signals to assess their discrimination power for the classification of real and synthetic voices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMai Ngoc Bui\nOur main interest is covariance matrices, which appear in many contexts, such as in diffusion tensor imaging and volatilities for multiple financial assets.\nThe space of symmetric positive definite matrices is not only a convex cone, but also a smooth manifold. By endowing it with different Riemannian metrics, one can get different Riemannian structures of the manifold. There are two commonly used Riemannian metrics, namely the Log-Euclidean (LE) and Affine-Invariant (AI) metrics. Although much progress has been made towards reducing the computational cost of working with these, there are still many challenges if the goal is to employ a sampling algorithm on such a space.\nOur interest lies in constructing an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process on the space of covariance matrices, and fitting this model to data. For high-frequency data, the likelihood can be approximated using the Euler-Maruyama method in terms of the exponential map, making inference feasible. In the low-frequency setting, however, this is no longer possible.\nIn Euclidean space, the common approach is to use a data-augmentation algorithm, i.e. imputing latent data points between each adjacent pair of observations to allow the Euler-Maruyama method to give a better approximation to the likelihood. To do the same on a manifold requires a bridge sampler method on manifold. We have developed such a bridge sampler method, meaning that inference for low-frequency data can be performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcel Hirt\nI am interested in Bayesian inference, particularly when the computation of the posterior distribution is challenging.\nApproximation methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can be unsatisfactory because they scale poorly to large datasets. I have therefore been working on variational inference methods that instead of sampling from the posterior distribution, try to solve an optimization problem: find a distribution within some variational family that is close to the posterior distribution. However, if the variational family is not very flexible, one can end up with a bias, in contrast to MCMC methods that have some asymptotic guarantees.\nConstructing good approximation families has been an ongoing challenge, because such families should be both flexible but also computationally efficient at the same time. A classic approach is to assume a so called mean-field variational family, where all components are independent. While computationally efficient, this can be a poor approximation. I have developed a new approximating family motivated by copulas. The basic idea to sample from this new distribution is to first sample from a distribution on the hypercube and then apply Gaussian quantile functions and a rotation. The resulting distribution can be more flexible than a Gaussian approximation.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew ‘copula-like’ variational family approximation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay on top of the latest news and research coming from the Department of Statistical Science by visiting: www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics."

The department’s equality and diversity committee, chaired by Alex Donov and Niloufar Abourashchi, meets regularly and works to ensure that the principles of the charter are upheld.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring my first meeting with Alex Donov, he explained that at UCL Statistics, there are roughly equal proportions of men and women across the BSc and MSc levels. However, from the PhD level onwards, there is an imbalance: the proportion of male students is larger.\nTo find out more about this imbalance, surveys were conducted among groups of students in the department. I was responsible for the processing and analysis of a survey conducted among a cohort of MSc students at the end of their course. The main tasks were filing the paper survey answers into an electronic data set and analysing this data set. The analysis mainly consisted of trying out different techniques to visualise the data as clearly as possible. In the next Athena SWAN meeting, I will present the results from this analysis.\nSo far, I have really enjoyed working on the project. It feels as if the work is appreciated and I was given real responsibility, which is very motivating. I have learned a lot in the process, partly because of useful feedback on my work and partly because it was a nice challenge to rise to. I hope to contribute some ideas based on the data in the upcoming months.\nLook out for Doranne’s results in a future edition of Sample Space.\n\n\nThe Numbers Game\nUCL has long been at the forefront of promoting women within mathematical sciences.\nTwenty-five years ago, the department initiated a Celebrating Women in Mathematics day, aimed at encouraging aspiring female mathematicians to study at UCL. With the ongoing commitment of staff and students, this event has run almost every year since, and is now a firmly established annual departmental event.\nPast events, including Celebrating Women in Mathematics, have attracted audiences numbering over 300. And the cross-departmental meeting series UCL Women in Mathematical Sciences, which organises several events per year, is also highly subscribed.\nThe IMSS will enable us to increase our engagement with groups that are under-represented within the discipline, and ensure that UK mathematical science attracts talent that is as diverse as possible."

    "text": "Professor Serge Guillas is leading a team seeking better ways to predict potentially disastrous tsunamis using high-performance computing… \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently, major tsunamis in Indonesia and Japan have caused the insurance industry and civil authorities around the world to demand better models to assess tsunami risk. In particular, the economic impacts of the tsunamis include losses of livelihoods and incomes, loss of boats and gear among fishing communities, and increased levels of poverty in the aftermath of the event.\nTo model tsunami waves and currents, and their uncertainties, UCL’s research group of PhD students, postdocs, and research software engineers is making use of high-performance computing (HPC).\nProf Guillas is leading several projects to improve both long-term risk assessments and short-term warnings using HPC and modern statistical methods:\nUQM3: ‘Uncertainty Quantification Of Multi-scale And Multi-physics Computer Models: Applications To Hazard And Climate’ in collaboration with the Universities of Oxford, Warwick and Exeter. Running from 01/10/2018 – 30/09/2020.\nThis project aims to answer some of the questions around natural events, such as tsunamis, earthquakes or climate changes, by quantifying the uncertainties in complex simulators.\nUncertainty Quantification uses surrogate models that allow the uncertainties to be modelled more efficiently. However, designing a workflow that integrates models as diverse as natural phenomena is a challenge.\nWhen applied to natural events, it’s hoped that Uncertainty Quantification will help us carry out risk assessments around the impact of earthquakes or tsunamis, for example. This will help us understand how to build resilient infrastructure and protect populations.\nUQM3’s research is carried out at the Alan Turing Institute - the national institute for data science and artificial intelligence - with headquarters at the British Library. It’s part of the Data-centric Engineering (DCE) programme of the Turing.\nRADDISH: ‘Real-Time Advanced Data Assimilation for Digital Simulation of Numerical Twins on HPC’, funded by the Strategic Priorities Fund, EPSRC AI for Science and Government. Running from 01/08/2019 – 31/07/2020.\nBased at the Turing Institute, RADDISH is implementing agent-based models to facilitate tsunami warnings and evacuation modelling.\nUsing high performance computers, a digital twin of a tsunami event can track actions in real-time using live data. We can accurately monitor how an event would unfold and identify areas where changes can be made to procedure to improve the safety of those involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVETII: ‘Vessels Evacuation from Tsunamis in India and Indonesia’, funded by the Grand Challenge Research Fund (GCRF). Running from 01/01/2020 – 30/06/2020.\nVETII uses accurate agent-based models of vessels in ports around India and Indonesia and applies probabilistic tsunami current hazard assessments to simulated models.\nWe can apply different scenarios to these models to see how quickly people can evacuate when a tsunami occurs, ultimately creating the most efficient layout for boats in different ports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFITTER: ‘Future Indonesian Tsunamis: Towards End-to-end Risk Quantification’ funded by the Lloyd’s Tercentenary Research Foundation, the Lighthill Risk Network and the Lloyd’s Register Foundation. Running from 2019 – 2022.\nFITTER will focus on the risk of a tsunami hitting areas of important infrastructure. We will produce stochastic tsunami hazard footprints, new vulnerability functions for the resilience of infrastructure such as ports, and for the livelihood of populations. This open model will be of use to both Government and the insurance industry, and enable modern disaster risk financing for Indonesia.\n‘Uncertainty Quantification for Tsunamis’ on the Cambridge Service for Data Driven Discovery (CSD3) facility, EPSRC tier 2 HPC. Running from 01/10/2018 – 30/09/2022.\nIn this project, we’re assessing tsunami simulations on the UK’s largest graphical processing unit (GPU) cluster. This means we can use Uncertainty Quantification to predict the complex nature of tsunamis with more accuracy and detail.\nEarly warnings using satellites Running from 2019 – 2023.\nIn collaboration with the University of Shizuoka (Japan), and with UCL PhD student Ryuichi Kanai funded by the Japan Student Services Organization, we aim to collect signals within minutes of the tsunami from the ionosphere through GPS satellites.\nAGITHAR Prof Guillas is also UK representative and Chair of the Working group on Uncertainties, in the COST action ‘Accelerating Global Science in Tsunami Hazard and Risk Analysis’ (2019-2023, 25 countries). This network will improve, standardise, and promote tsunami research.\nYou can find the latest developments in Professor Guillas’ research by visiting: https://www.turing.ac.uk.\n\nImpact on populations: Prof Guillas visited the region of Mumbai, India, in 2018 and 2019, to engage with the fishermen community. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has been facilitating our disaster resilience project in the region."

    "text": "The Department of Statistical Science, in conjunction with the Royal Statistical Society, hosted a symposium on Teaching Statistics in April 2019. The event was organised by the department’s Teaching Fellows, with the aim of bringing together those who teach statistics in higher education to hear about, and discuss, exciting developments in the field. Over 60 people from around the UK attended and took part in a number of lively debates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first session focused on teaching non-statisticians and featured contributions from Margaret MacDougall (University of Edinburgh), who discussed the statistics that medical students need to learn and how they might retain that knowledge in the long term, and Charalampos Chanialidis (University of Glasgow), who described how an online MSc in Data Analytics was established and implemented. Virtual learning and approaches to teaching non-statisticians both provoked interesting discussion.\nAfter lunch we concentrated on teaching statisticians. Elke Thonnes (University of Warwick) considered authentic learning which provides useful data-centric skills for students including statistical consultancy, and then Paul Northrop (UCL) talked about a research-based learning initiative wherein undergraduates read an academic paper, discuss it with the author and then summarise their findings. Both included a section on group assessment which was clearly of interest to many present.\nThe symposium concluded with a panel discussion on the future of teaching statistics. Panel members included Rachel Hilliam from the Open University, Andy Field from the University of Sussex (who is known for his cartoon-based books on statistics), and Sharon Witherspoon, the Royal Statistical Society’s Vice President for Education and Statistical Literacy. The discussion encompassed subjects such as data science, the use of statistical software, short courses for professionals and remote teaching. These topics exemplified the diversity of approaches that will inevitably proliferate over the coming years.\nThe symposium was followed by the launch of the RSS Special Interest Group on Teaching Statistics, chaired by Elinor Jones (UCL)."

It’s also a vast and evolving discipline, and with more research staff interacting with other UCL departments and visiting scholars, the IMSS will allow us to cover most of its research areas.\nWe’ve seen the power of joint research across many of our other departments, and bringing great minds together will lead to fundamental breakthroughs across disciplines. The IMSS wants to create an atmosphere of lively research collaboration between mathematical sciences and other departments across UCL.\nWith a concentration of around 135 academic and teaching staff, from early career professionals to established world-leading researchers, the IMSS will support a thriving community of students who will get to experience cross-disciplinary interaction everyday. We will recruit and nurture outstanding mathematicians and statisticians, and provide an environment in which they can flourish and contribute to wider society. Beyond UCL, the IMSS will fully exploit its central London location by strengthening interactions with institutions like the Alan Turing Institute, the Francis Crick Institute, GCHQ, London’s financial industry and government departments. It will also be internationally accessible, with facilities and a forward-thinking events programme to bring our research to the wider world. We aim to host national and international meetings, conferences and workshops in the mathematical sciences, with involvement from learned societies in our disciplines."

    "text": "Embracing the next generation\nSociety’s demand for trained mathematicians and statisticians has never been higher. To meet this, universities have a responsibility to encourage young people to enter the discipline.\nThrough high-profile presenters like UCL Mathematics alumna Hannah Fry, the mathematical sciences and their applications are enjoying unprecedented popular appeal. The IMSS will help to capture the public’s interest and imagination, and stimulate the uptake of mathematical sciences by school leavers – in particular from groups that are currently under-represented in the profession. We aim to host popular talks and practical sessions designed to turn more young people on to a career in mathematical sciences and show how it can open doors to so many different industries.\nFor students already wanting to study a mathematical discipline, our graduates will receive a broad training in mathematics, statistics and their applications, with experience in programming and computation, and with opportunities to develop their communication skills.\nThe IMSS will host over 1,200 mathematical science undergraduates at the heart of its activity. They’ll join an intellectually thrilling community led by world-leading researchers in modern high-quality teaching facilities. Students will take advanced courses connecting with exciting research developments, like the rapid expansion of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, both areas for which mathematics provides the fundamental language.\nAt postgraduate level, the IMSS will be home to 150 MSc students and over 200 doctoral students. MSc students will have their own study and social areas, while doctoral students, the lifeblood of any university mathematical science institute, will be fully integrated with academic staff, with access to shared social and common areas.\nTo find out more about the future of the IMSS, and see the latest developments: visit www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-statistical-sciences"

UCL is proud to be a founding partner in the scheme, and in July 2019, the Department of Statistical Science welcomed five Year 12 students for an inspirational week of learning that statistics is not, in fact, boring!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlacements in the mathematical sciences are a new venture for in2science and we were delighted to be one of the first departments to host students interested in maths.\nThe students, who came from in and around London, spent the week visiting various members of staff. We wanted the students to witness first-hand how diverse statistics as a subject actually is, and in doing so we were hoping to show them that statistics at university is a lot more interesting than what they do in school! They learnt some R with Elinor Jones and were able to use their new-found skills to build models with Tom Fearn.\nOther highlights included learning about forensic statistics with Ardo Van den Hout, trying out some maths with Sam Livingstone, and discussing risk and disaster statistics with Katerina Stavrianaki. They even had a morning discussing statistics and crop genetics with Michael Scott – a researcher from the Division of Biosciences at UCL – who gave them a primer on genetics before showing how statistics is used in crop research.\nFor some of the students, the highlight was spending a morning at the Turing Institute with Franz Kiraly. The Turing Institute, which is housed at the British Library on Euston Road, is a very inspiring space. There they spent the morning discussing data science, and the students certainly returned to the Department of Statistical Science with even more enthusiasm for learning statistics.\nWe certainly changed the students’ minds about statistics by the end of the week – they all agreed that statistics was far more interesting than they ever thought possible. Intriguingly, they commented that statistics as a subject was completely different to what they perceived it to be. It’s encouraging that most of the students ended the week keen to study at least some statistics at university.\nWe’re looking forward to showing more school students just how great studying statistics can be, and why it’s so important to be statistically literate."

    "text": "Mete Veyisoglu spent a year studying MSc Data Science at UCL in 2018/19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I decided to apply for UCL’s MSc in Data Science, I had been working at Koc University (Istanbul, Turkey) as institutional planning manager for five years. My duties comprised various data-related tasks such as forecasting, financial planning and data-driven decision-making to shape future strategy. I had huge amounts of academic data at my disposal, and I had to be both creative in coming up with various statistics to depict the institution’s outlook and also very careful not to make any scientific errors as it would lead to incorrect decisions.\nIn short, I needed more expertise in the fields of statistics and machine learning. I chose UCL for its strong tradition in statistics (this was a pioneering statistics department, where many of the founders of the discipline worked), its historic Bloomsbury location that is very central but also pleasantly remote from the busy tourist and commuter crowds, and its general reputation as one of the best universities in the world.\nI had to decide between two programmes, MSc in Data Science offered by the Statistics department and MSc in Data Science and Machine Learning offered by the Computer Science department. I chose the first one mainly because I am more oriented towards mathematics and statistics, and I wanted to learn about the classical fundamentals. As the probabilist and risk guru Nassim Nicholas Taleb says in his bestseller ‘Skin In The Game’: “No statistics without logic, no mathematics without proof, no facts without rigor”. Today, the amount of data available in any domain is huge and it is very easy to mistake noise for signal and find interesting but misleading patterns in data. I was hoping to gain the skills to identify these pitfalls.\nReality usually falls short of meeting our expectations, but my year in the Statistics department was an exception to this rule. Not only did I see that all my reasons for choosing UCL and the Data Science programme proved to be correct, but I also found that my classmates were brilliant people. I learned as much from them as I did from the classes.\nOne huge advantage of the programme is that it’s cross-disciplinary, so we had colleagues from a variety of backgrounds such as mathematics, physics, economics and engineering. This made the postgraduate study room a great place to learn from each other. Also, UCL and the Statistics department are doing a great job of listening to students. Faculty members, MSc tutors and administrative management genuinely work towards finding solutions to student-reported issues. This determination to resolve issues, in turn, increased my motivation to learn.\nIn the fall and spring terms, I took very interesting modules including Introduction to Machine Learning, Introduction to Statistical Data Science, Financial Data and Statistics, Extreme Value Theory, and Copula Theory, among others. I loved the system in the UK where you take all the year’s exams in May, so you are not ‘done’ with the fall semester modules in December. This is a good way to ensure that students learn for life, not just for school.\nThe summer term was dedicated to the research project, and it was both challenging and fun. I chose to work on an issue related to my job at Koc University: using statistical and machine learning methods to predict which college students are more likely to fail and eventually drop out of college. I think I worked harder in summer than in either of the other terms – it’s really challenging to deliver a UCL-level MSc dissertation in three months! Nevertheless, I loved the challenge of working on a longer-term project, making small steps of progress every day. I had weekly meetings with my supervisor, Dr. Thomas Honnor, who was very supportive and helped me keep my stamina and my motivation up through summer. In the end, we both were very content with the resulting work. The models that I developed will have huge practical value for Koc University, and the thesis could even serve as a model on how to use data science to increase data-driven policy-making in Turkish Higher Education.\nThe quantitative skills I gained and the brilliant people I met during my year at UCL indicate that this was not a chapter you close and move on from; but one that will always guide you through your career. I am certain that my classmates feel the same.\nLook out for more student stories in future editions of Sample Space."

I predicted the number of incoming migrants for each EU state in 2017, based on historical socio-economic, education, healthcare and welfare data that I gathered and sorted from the UN, Eurostat and OECD Statistics. The workload was definitely more than what I was used to at UCL, since weekly assignments and midterms grades were emphasised alongside the final exam. I definitely recommend taking project-based classes for students who are looking to travel around.\nOutside of academics, I travelled to cities along the West and East Coasts of the US, plus Toronto, Montréal and Cancun. Although I was only there for two terms, I was fortunate enough to be able to pledge a fraternity and compete nationally with the rugby squad. For those in the first and second year, studying abroad as part of the MSci International Programme is something I’d definitely recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\nHannah Summers\nSnow. Squirrels. Study. The three pillars to my eight-month venture into the world of University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.\nWith six months below zero degrees celsius, and Christmas spent on the Great Lakes, the experience was unlike any I have had before. Days were spent watching the squirrels (both brown and black) through my window whilst I studied, exploring the local craft beers and visiting nearby lakes.\nI studied a wide variety of topics from function estimation, to group theory, to classification, to the epistemology of ignorance. And I undertook national data science competitions whilst investigating the connection between the herb valerian and insomnia. I had the opportunity to experience refreshingly different styles of teaching and explore new areas of learning, in particular a fascinating look at the world of data visualisation.\nWaterloo was the perfect balance of the known (the language, studying, coffee) and the unknown (the people, food and the arrival of the geese). The year was a beautiful adventure filled with many a FaceTime chat, the best burgers, and perfect crisp blue mornings. I look forward to one day returning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents who are interested in participating in the Erasmus programme can find out more by visiting: www.ucl.ac.uk/students/go-abroad/study-abroad-and-erasmus."

I hope you find the contents interesting: we plan to do more of this kind of thing in the future, to keep you all updated with the latest news from the department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCL Statistical Science is currently undergoing a period of significant expansion: this is part undergoing of and a strategic operational investment in mathematics, statistics and operational research that will lead to the establishment of a UCL Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, or IMSS for short. We plan for the Statistical Science and Mathematics departments to be re-housed next to each other on a single site, in a purpose-designed facility that will put UCL on the map as one of the ‘go-to’ places for the mathematical sciences in London – and that will also provide our students with a much greater sense of community than is currently possible. Bringing this idea to fruition has already taken considerable effort, and will continue to do so in the coming months and years, although I strongly believe that the rewards will be well worth it. Apart from anything else, being bigger gives us additional resources to do things like producing Sample Space!\nThe department has also recently established a new master’s programme in Data Science, which has proven very popular with students. A recent graduate, Mete Veyisoglu, has kindly taken the time to share his experiences of the programme in this issue. Further curriculum developments are being undertaken at the moment to ensure that we continue to equip our students with the tools to be statistically literate, perhaps a more desirable skill than ever in today’s world.\nOn the research side, the recent announcement of a large increase in UK government funding for the mathematical sciences is very welcome, and particularly timely in view of our IMSS expansion plans. Final preparations are underway for REF 2021, the latest iteration of the UK’s ‘Research Excellence Framework’. The department’s performance in this exercise will also contribute to the level of government funding we receive for the next few years. We have excellent staff doing exciting and incredibly diverse research, some of which is making a real impact outside academia: this issue highlights work being done by Serge Guillas and his team on understanding tsunami risk around the world.\nAs always, there are external challenges: as I write, UK universities are grappling with the uncertainties posed by Brexit and, more urgently, by the worldwide Covid-19 outbreak. UCL Statistical Science is such a thoroughly international community that these issues will certainly affect us to some extent. I very much hope, however, that the effects will be minimal for all of us.\nFinally, I would like to extend my very sincere thanks to everyone who contributed to this first issue of Sample Space, and in particular to Samuel Livingstone for coordinating and editing it. If any readers have feedback, or potential contributions to future issues, or suggestions for material that they’d like to see, please contact him at samuel.livingstone@ucl.ac.uk. I think he and all the contributors have done a fantastic job: I hope you do too."

Firstly, to remind each other of what we looked like in person – following around 18 months of online meetings – and to communally prepare for the new academic year. Secondly, to acknowledge a change at the top, as Professor Richard Chandler stepped down as head of department following his five-year tenure, to be replaced by the incoming Professor Gianluca Baio.\nProfessor Chandler oversaw many changes during his time at the helm. The past five years have been a period of expansion and relative success for the department, as the popularity of data science as a discipline has continued to grow.\nBut of course, a very significant part of his role was to lead the department through the pandemic. It was a period in which many difficult decisions had to be made in a very short space of time, amidst an ever-changing landscape of new government rules and recommendations. This meant employing different modes of teaching and modified expectations on how both staff and students should conduct themselves within the (at many times virtual) department.\nUpon stepping down, Professor Chandler received a special departmental award, acknowledging his efforts in “guiding the department through a period of expansion and a global pandemic.”\nOf course, another good reason for the meeting was to have some fun, and despite the provision of an emergency gazebo in case of rain, the sun shone brightly – a welcome reminder that Murphy’s law still carries with it some notion of uncertainty.\nOne of the highlights of the day was the soft archery session conducted by Discovery Archery Ltd. A special mention for bravery goes to Professor Codina Cotar, who volunteered herself without hesitation when the organisers asked if anyone was prepared to act as a human target. Students beware, Professor Cotar has nerves of steel!\nOther shenanigans included a mime artist, a giant chess board and a carnival ‘test your strength’ machine, an activity that – funnily enough – no-one among the faculty seemed to be very adept at.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a great day, and served to mark the achievements of the departing Professor Chandler with high spirits and smiles all round."

We’re now accustomed to the daily reports of new positive COVID-19 tests, and we’ve become adept at analysing the graphs showing these stats, often normalised per 100,000 of population to allow for comparison across countries and regions.\nIn July 2020, the then US President Donald Trump observed: “if we did half the testing, we would have half the cases.” He’s not wrong: the number of identified cases is highly dependent on the number of tests taken. A country rife with COVID-19 but with zero testing capacity might, according to this metric, appear to be having a wonderful pandemic."

    "section": "Why it matters who we test",
    "text": "Why it matters who we test\nA related – but more subtle – point surrounds the question of who gets tested. Most countries have implemented targeted testing schemes, focusing their limited testing capacity on specific groups of people. For example, in England, individuals are asked to take a PCR test if they have particular symptoms (high temperature, continuous cough, or loss of taste or smell). Similarly, healthcare professionals have to get regular tests in order to protect the people they’re caring for.\nThese targeted groups are more likely than the overall population to test positive for COVID-19, either because they have symptoms, or because they work in care homes, hospitals etc and are at a higher risk of catching the virus. This means that the number of positive test counts isn’t necessarily an accurate reflection of the true prevalence of the virus: the proportion of the entire population infected at any particular point in time is typically less than the proportion we would infer directly from the targeted test data.\nThis difference can be quite extreme, with the proportion of targeted tests returning a positive result (the ‘positivity rate’) often exceeding the underlying prevalence proportion by an order of magnitude (Figure 2, top row). Despite this, targeted test data is commonly used to estimate prevalence and the now-familiar effective reproduction number, Rt (the average number of people that an infected person will go on to infect)."

    "text": "The benefits of randomised surveillance\nIn England, we are very fortunate to have not one but two national, randomised surveillance studies that measure the level of coronavirus infection in the community: the COVID-19 Infection Survey (carried out by the Office for National Statistics) and the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study (Imperial College London). The randomised nature of these studies ensures that they provide representative estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence across the entire population, not just among symptomatics or frontline workers.\nRunning these studies is expensive, however, and most of the tests will be negative by definition if the overall population prevalence is just a few percent. So, the number of positive tests returned is relatively small in comparison to the targeted testing schemes. As a result, randomised studies provide prevalence estimates that, while accurately targeting the true prevalence on average, may be highly variable when considering smaller areas.\nThat said, such fine-scale, localised estimates are incredibly useful for policy makers when they need to prepare resources for healthcare systems or design interventions to control the spread of disease, such as increases in testing capacity or social restrictions."

    "section": "Our quest for accurate and fine-scale prevalence estimates",
    "text": "Our quest for accurate and fine-scale prevalence estimates\nIn our work, recently published in Nature Microbiology, we sought to combine the targeted test counts with data from randomised surveillance studies, to provide debiased, local, weekly estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. We did so through a causal statistical framework that estimates the probability of an infected person being tested versus a non-infected person being tested, and then transforms targeted test counts appropriately to generate debiased estimates of the true underlying local prevalence.\nInference for this model consisted of four steps. First, we inferred weekly prevalence at a coarse geographic level from the randomised testing data. Second, we combined this prevalence with the targeted testing data to get an estimate of the probability of an infected person being tested, again at the coarser spatial scale. Third, we smoothed these estimates longitudinally, working under the assumption that the probability an infected person gets tested only varies a little from week to week. Finally, we used these smoothed estimates to infer local (finer geographical scale) prevalence from the targeted test counts.\nFigure 2 shows our statistical framework in action. The top row of panels shows the uncorrected test positivity rate against REACT prevalence estimates for the 311 local authorities in England, illustrating how test positivity was upwardly biased. The bottom row of panels shows how our prevalence estimates are unbiased relative to the REACT estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop row: uncorrected COVID-19 test positivity rate vs. REACT prevalence estimates for the 311 local authorities in England. Bottom row: debiased prevalence estimates vs. REACT prevalence estimates. The error bars associated with our estimates are much smaller than the REACT error bars, pointing to the increase in precision we get by including the targeted test data.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also use our framework to estimate the effective reproduction number Rt in different local authorities. We do this by fitting an epidemic model to the debiased data, which allows us to track the state of individuals from ‘susceptible’ to ‘infected’ to ‘recovered’ (known as an SIR model). We found that local estimates of Rt were indicative of one- to two-week-ahead changes in the number of positive tests, and that increases in estimated local prevalence and Rt reflected the spread of both the Alpha and Delta variants of the virus. Figure 3 uses our data to show the spread of the Alpha variant in December 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial distribution of debiased SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (maps on left), Rt (maps in centre) and the Alpha variant frequency (maps on right, measured by % S-gene target failure, SGTF) for the two weeks of 6 and 20 December 2020 (top and bottom respectively). The increased transmissibility of the Alpha variant is further illustrated in the scatter plots on the right, which plot Rt against the Alpha variant frequency (% SGTF) for each ‘lower-tier local authority’ (LTLA). We report results for 311 LTLAs in England, split into nine regions.\n\n\n\n\nOur work demonstrates how randomised surveys such as REACT can complement targeted testing to improve statistical accuracy in monitoring the spread of COVID-19. We believe that the international response to the current pandemic, as well as preparedness for future ones, can benefit from surveillance schemes that combine random sampling with targeted testing in this way. Used together, these techniques will provide a powerful way of keeping track of emerging and ongoing infectious diseases."

    "section": "Subjective science",
    "text": "Subjective science\nFirst emerging as a named discipline in the 19th century, eugenics is the study of how to arrange reproduction among a human population in such a way that characteristics or traits that are deemed to be desirable are spread, whereas those that are not deemed desirable are reduced. The goal, put simply, was to create a superior race through selective breeding. Eugenics gained much traction towards the end of the 19th century among many leading thinkers, and continued to grow in popularity during the early 20th century.\nOne fundamental issue with the idea was that the notion of ‘desirability’ is inherently subjective, and it is therefore easy for those with a particular agenda or prejudices to label certain subsets of a population as ‘not desirable’. Such prejudices were clearly displayed in the Second World War, during which eugenics ideas were enthusiastically adopted by the Nazis. Largely as a result of this, after 1945 the discipline was quietly phased out of mainstream scholarly thought.\nUnfortunately, the history of statistics as a discipline is closely linked to the study of eugenics. The term ‘eugenics’ was coined by Francis Galton, who had close links to UCL. Galton, alongside Karl Pearson, sought to put his flawed ideas on a firm scientific basis, a pursuit which resulted in several methodological advances which, although developed to support unethical research, still form a key part of statistical practice to this day.\nThe history of the Department of Statistical Science at UCL is intrinsically linked to Galton’s legacy. While Galton never held a formal academic post here, upon his death in 1911 he left his fortune to UCL. This was to fund the Galton professorship of eugenics – a role that was filled by Karl Pearson and led directly to the founding of the Department of Applied Statistics."

    "text": "New perspective\nThe inquiry returned its recommendations in 2020 and UCL has begun to act. In January 2021, UCL formally apologised for its role in the development, propagation, and legitimisation of eugenics. This apology has been accompanied by action in removing the names of Galton and Pearson from buildings, lecture rooms and prizes, as well as supporting further research into improving equality and diversity.\nThese changes are already being implemented in the Department of Statistical Science. The previously named Galton Lecture Theatre is now simply room 115, and a notice is on display outside the room explaining why this has happened. Additionally, all new students in the department now receive a short talk on the history of the department, including its role in the history of eugenics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Professor Fearn is keen to point out, even though this research was conducted at the start of the 20th century, the fundamentally flawed ideas still provide important lessons for modern statisticians. He says: “We need to be careful that we don’t do bad statistics… it’s really easy to see things in data that you want to see and ignore things that you don’t want to see.”\nHe also stresses that these are not only concerns for applied statisticians: “We need to think about where our research might lead. Even if we are doing mathematics, we can’t think that what we are doing is neut"

    "section": "",
    "text": "When I moved to London in September 2019, I never expected that I would be able to divide my graduate studies into two parts: experiences pre- and during a worldwide pandemic.\nWhile studying for a BSc in Economics and Management in Hanover, Germany, I discovered my passion for statistics and programming. To further dive into these topics and get a completely new perspective on academic life, I decided to apply for graduate degrees in data science in the UK. In the end, UCL’s MSc Data Science programme drew me in with its combination of rigorous statistical training offered by the Department of Statistical Science and insights into recent topics in machine learning provided by the Department of Computer Science. Of course, I was also excited to join the truly diverse and international community at UCL, and to enjoy the vibrant city of London.\nAfter a foundation fortnight bringing all students from mathematical and statistical backgrounds to the same page, I attended courses ranging from introductions to data science and machine learning to selected advanced topics in statistics. The module contents did not fall short of my expectations. What I particularly enjoyed, however, was being taught by lecturers who are on the frontier of research in their field, but very approachable and open for discussion at the same time. My cohort turned out to be a group of extremely smart people coming from a broad range of academic backgrounds, with each bringing in different perspectives. The group assignments ended up being especially inspiring for that reason.\nTo find a balance between studying and relaxation, I also enjoyed playing for the UCL tennis team. For BUCS Wednesdays, we travelled through England and Wales, and the tennis society became something of a home away from home.\nWhile the threat of a COVID-19 pandemic started looming on the horizon by the end of February 2020, it was only by the end of March that we could feel the immediate impact at UCL. Lectures finally had to move online for the last week of term 2 and social gatherings were cancelled altogether. However, both the Statistical Science and Computer Science departments did a great job of making a smooth transition, and quickly prepared online exams as well as other alternative assessments that could be taken from around the world. Clearly, this was a difficult time for everyone, but all kinds of online events organised by fellow students and societies helped us stay connected during lockdown.\nAfter the exam period, the MSc programme culminated in a research project. The disruption caused by the pandemic led to supervision being online rather than face-to-face, but I felt this worked perfectly well. I worked on a project on ‘Scalable inference for generative models using quasi-Monte Carlo’ supervised by Dr François-Xavier Briol, which pushed me far beyond everything I had learnt so far. Working on the MSc project itself would have been an intense and challenging experience at any time, but doing so in the isolation of a lockdown in a foreign country was even more so. However, through great support from my supervisor and my fellow students, with whom I could exchange thoughts and feedback, it also became a very rewarding time.\nAfter completing the MSc project, my supervisor proposed turning the thesis into a paper in a joint effort with another student, Ziang Niu, who was visiting the Statistical Science department as an undergraduate student during that year. As this was the first paper I had worked on, I was going through all stages of a research project for the first time, learning how a collaboration, in which everyone has their specialisations, results in very efficient teamwork.\nWriting this paper gave me the opportunity to develop my scientific coding and writing skills further, all of which provided me with a head start for the PhD that I am now pursuing in Hanover, Germany. Here, my work is focused on the intersection of machine learning and time series analysis, and I am still profiting from the great network I was able to build through the Statistical Science department at UCL. Many of my fellow students went into research, both in academia and industry, and we keep in touch, motivating and stimulating each other.\nIn retrospect, coming to London to pursue the MSc Data Science gave me so much more than a degree – it boosted my quantitative skills and left me with a network of bright and caring people, despite the COVID-19 disruptions."

The workshop was free to attend and open to Year 12/S5 students from non-selective UK state schools who were studying mathematics or similar at A level.\nArmed with a laptop, instead of a deerstalker and magnifying glass, the aim was for students to spend the week exploring a data set, learning new data analysis skills along the way and presenting their findings to the rest of the students on the final day."

One dataset was a Google Play set of Android mobile phone apps, each with number of downloads, star rating, price, as well as various characteristics about each app such as title and category. The other was a dataset on the World Happiness Index which related “happiness index” with various characteristics of each country such as GDP, life expectancy and corruption.\nTo enable the students to carry out meaningful data exploration, we taught them the basics of using the R language with RStudio Cloud, with no prior experience assumed.\nEach day was structured with a mix of virtual lessons/demonstrations, group work and information sessions. The students were split into teams of four or five to apply their newly acquired skills by working collaboratively, ultimately producing a presentation at the end of the week. Each team was supported throughout by enthusiastic and dedicated current UCL undergraduate student ambassadors from whom they could seek advice."

They developed their skills in how to explore data, how to dig down into the data by summarising, rearranging, tabulating and plotting, and how to communicate what they found.\nOn the final day, the teams gave presentations to the rest of the group and then voted on their favourite. Prizes of £100 book vouchers (hopefully to be spent on data analysis books!) were awarded for the best presentations. Clear progress had been made and the quality of the final presentations was excellent.\nData Detectives was led by Alex Watson and developed and delivered by Alex, Elinor Jones, Sam Livingstone, Nathan Green and Ioanna Manolopoulou."
