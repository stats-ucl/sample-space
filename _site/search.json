I hope you find the contents interesting: we plan to do more of this kind of thing in the future, to keep you all updated with the latest news from the department.\n\n\n\n\nA bunch of people in the department\n\n\nUCL Statistical Science is currently undergoing a period of significant expansion: this is part undergoing of and a strategic operational investment in mathematics, statistics and operational research that will lead to the establishment of a UCL Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, or IMSS for short. We plan for the Statistical Science and Mathematics departments to be re-housed next to each other on a single site, in a purpose-designed facility that will put UCL on the map as one of the ‘go-to’ places for the mathematical sciences in London – and that will also provide our students with a much greater sense of community than is currently possible. Bringing this idea to fruition has already taken considerable effort, and will continue to do so in the coming months and years, although I strongly believe that the rewards will be well worth it. Apart from anything else, being bigger gives us additional resources to do things like producing Sample Space!\nThe department has also recently established a new master’s programme in Data Science, which has proven very popular with students. A recent graduate, Mete Veyisoglu, has kindly taken the time to share his experiences of the programme in this issue. Further curriculum developments are being undertaken at the moment to ensure that we continue to equip our students with the tools to be statistically literate, perhaps a more desirable skill than ever in today’s world.\nOn the research side, the recent announcement of a large increase in UK government funding for the mathematical sciences is very welcome, and particularly timely in view of our IMSS expansion plans. Final preparations are underway for REF 2021, the latest iteration of the UK’s ‘Research Excellence Framework’. The department’s performance in this exercise will also contribute to the level of government funding we receive for the next few years. We have excellent staff doing exciting and incredibly diverse research, some of which is making a real impact outside academia: this issue highlights work being done by Serge Guillas and his team on understanding tsunami risk around the world.\nAs always, there are external challenges: as I write, UK universities are grappling with the uncertainties posed by Brexit and, more urgently, by the worldwide Covid-19 outbreak. UCL Statistical Science is such a thoroughly international community that these issues will certainly affect us to some extent. I very much hope, however, that the effects will be minimal for all of us.\nFinally, I would like to extend my very sincere thanks to everyone who contributed to this first issue of Sample Space, and in particular to Samuel Livingstone for coordinating and editing it. If any readers have feedback, or potential contributions to future issues, or suggestions for material that they’d like to see, please contact him at samuel.livingstone@ucl.ac.uk. I think he and all the contributors have done a fantastic job: I hope you do too."

    "text": "I am very excited to introduce the second issue of the departmental magazine in my relatively new role as head of the department — I’ve taken over from Richard in September 2021 (you can read some sassy details of the transition in this issue). You may judge me if I say this out loud, but I was and still am very excited and proud to become the head of the department where, essentially, I have spent my entire adult career!\nThe last two years have been incredibly complicated for everyone and our community has certainly been no exception — I think we owe my predecessor a great debt of gratitude for all of his hard work, as we navigated through the Covid years. All of us had to come to terms with a different way of living and working, including amusing hours of home-schooling the children, while converting all our lecture slides into html formats and figuring out how to deliver an online lecture while ensuring that at least one of the students was still awake by the end of it… It goes without saying, but I will nonetheless say thank you to all our amazing staff, who have gone beyond the call of duty. And of course, to all our students who had to live through the most absurd university experience. In this issue, we’ve collected some testimonies both from our staff and our students, as well as reported on some important work related to the pandemic emergency.\nBehind the scenes, a lot has been going on in the department (including some modern day testing experiments): in particular, we have continued our trajectory of sustained growth in our staff and the last two years have seen a significant intake of exciting new colleagues. I am particularly pleased of the fantastic group of what one may call “Early Career Researchers” that we have managed to attract in the past few years — some of our new colleagues introduce themselves in this issue. Their work has contributed to revive the vibrant environment in the department and expand the breadth of research themes and excellence in our community, including our amazing PhD students.\nSpeaking of research, I am also pleased to report that our results for the Research Excellence Framework (REF) exercise have been positive — our submission is joint with our cousins in Mathematics. We have improved on several metrics, including research impact and we have ranked 5th on “4/3” (which is an overall measure of world-leading and internationally excellent research). We now rank 8th for “research power” (a measure of research quality, weighted by the number of staff returned) and we are very close to the institutions sitting immediately above us in this metric. Personally, I think that we are still on a journey and we haven’t fully reaped the fruits of our investments in human resources and that the next one will be the REF in which we graduate to top 5 — I hope that we will continue to establish further our community and the sense of belonging for all our staff and students.\nIn the time since the last issue of Sample Space, we have also worked hard to establish a presence on several social medial channels: we now have a quite vibrant Twitter account and are active on Instagram and LinkedIn. This may sound unnecessarily chirpy and hipster, but I think these have already been very good media to generate discussion and showcase many of the activities that go on in the department (including the brilliant widening participation effort of Data Detectives, described here) and so am personally pleased that we have started developing them — for which I definitely need to thank our “Social Media Team” of Sam Livinstone, Javier Rubio, Brieuc Lehmann and Audrey Gbato. And: we’ve also started our podcast series (aptly named “Random Talks”), thanks to the brilliant work of Sam, Terry Soo, Nathan Green and Brieuc, who have already produced some super-interesting episodes, including one where Tom Fearn tells about his experience sitting on the UCL eugenics inquiry, which is also presented in this issue."
