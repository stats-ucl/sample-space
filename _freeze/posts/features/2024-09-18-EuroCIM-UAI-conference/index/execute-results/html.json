The conference consists mainly of poster and oral presentations, preceded by tutorials (which are essentially longer, more comprehensive oral presentations). With an audience whose research interests overlap significantly with mine, I've received some deeply insightful questions and feedback regarding my poster presentation and by extension our upcoming journal paper based on the poster that was presented ([which systematically studies conditions for causal discovery algorithms to work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07575)). During the tutorials, I even received research ideas on how to proceed with (salvage) an old abandoned research project!\n\nOn the penultimate day of the conference, we went to a Michelin Star restaurant, and had a three course conference dinner (which we suspect is heavily subsidised since we only paid Â£50). The conference seating is allocated randomly, which I think is a nice touch allowing for researchers from PhD to distinguished professors to interact. I've even met my [supervisor's](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucakksa/) supervisor (my academic grandpa, if you will) and sent him my supervisor's regards.\n\nThree months later, after braving the rebuttal process and getting our conference paper ([about a causal discovery algorithm relaxing the faithfulness condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14775)) accepted as a poster presentation, my supervisor and I attended the UAI conference. The conference covers mainly methods and theory in AI, with a substantial portion of the conference dedicated to causal inference this year. There were some familiar faces from previous conferences I've attended, and they provided some detailed feedback and enquiries about our poster presentation. With the conference venue right next to Barceloneta beach, and being in Barcelona during the summer, we just couldn't resist and went there a few times after a long day at the conference. My supervisor and I even went to have drinks with other conference participants.\n\nBeyond discussing research technicalities, I also obtained other 'soft' insights from conferences, like what is it like working in Academia, and how to keep motivated during research, how academia and industry interplay etc, which will definitely help me navigate my career post PhD. \n\n::: {layout=\"[65,35]\"}\n![](459425205_1076888587395144_7781050878042311601_n.jpg)\n\n![](458735588_3911484199081015_5561486920319041912_n.jpg)\n:::\n\n<br><br>\n\n:::: {.author-block}\n::: {style=\"float: left;margin-right: 20px;margin-top: -0px;margin-bottom:0px; object-fit:contain\"}\n![]({{< meta info.pic >}}){width=\"60px\" height=\"60px\" height=\"auto\" width=\"auto\\9\"}\n:::\n# **{{< meta info.author >}}**    \n## {{< meta info.bio >}}\n\n\n\n::::\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n<!--\nThis files first derives the relative path to the folder under which the page to share on selected social media is stored. \nThen it creates a series of sharing buttons --- currently implemented:\n- Twitter\n- Email\n- LinkedIn\n- Whatsapp\nOthers are fairly easy to create --- only need the fa icon of the relevant media + the combination of text that would be required\nto automatically share in on that platform\n-->\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n<br>\n<center>\n<!-- This uses a trick and an external widget to share on any of the federated servers on Mastodon\n   see: https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2022/06/create-a-share-to-mastodon-button-for-wordpress/\n-->\n[{{< fa brands mastodon size=lg title=\"Share on Mastodon\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://toot.kytta.dev/?text=Visits to the EuroCIM Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the UAI Conference in Barcelona, Spain. https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-18-EuroCIM-UAI-conference){target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,'targetWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=400px,height=600px'); return false;\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands twitter size=lg title=\"Share on Twitter\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-18-EuroCIM-UAI-conference/&text=Visits to the EuroCIM Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the UAI Conference in Barcelona, Spain.){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa envelope size=lg title=\"Share by email\" color=\"#383838\">}}](mailto:?subject=Visits to the EuroCIM Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the UAI Conference in Barcelona, Spain.&body=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-18-EuroCIM-UAI-conference){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands linkedin size=lg title=\"Share on LinkedIn\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-18-EuroCIM-UAI-conference/&title=Visits to the EuroCIM Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the UAI Conference in Barcelona, Spain.){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands whatsapp size=lg title=\"Share on Whatsapp\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=Visits to the EuroCIM Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the UAI Conference in Barcelona, Spain.https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-18-EuroCIM-UAI-conference/){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands reddit size=lg title=\"Share on Reddit\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-18-EuroCIM-UAI-conference/&title=Visits to the EuroCIM Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the UAI Conference in Barcelona, Spain.){target=\"_blank\"}\n</center>\n\n",
