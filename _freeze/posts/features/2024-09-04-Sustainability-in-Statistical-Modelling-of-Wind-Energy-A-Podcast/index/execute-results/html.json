Her research focuses on developing a probabilistic condition monitoring system for wind farms using SCADA data to detect faults and failures early. This system aims to enhance the sustainability of wind farms by reducing maintenance costs and improving overall reliability.\"\n\nimage: \"random-talks.jpg\" \ninfo:\n  author: \"Nathan Green\"\n  pic: \"nathan-green_0.png\"\n  bio: \"Nathan has a number of years experience working on a wide range of projects across government and academia in defence and health. Nathan studied mathematics and statistics at the University of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne and obtained a PhD in applied probability from the University of Liverpool. After working for the Ministry of Defence for several years, applying novel Bayesian Inference ideas, he moved back into academia and the field of public health in 2010.\"\n  website: \"https://n8thangreen.github.io/\"\n---\n\n:::{.img-right}\n![](sample_space_thumbnail.png){width=\"15%\"}\n:::\n\n[https://soundcloud.com/uclsound/sustainability-in-statistical-modelling-of-wind-energy-with-domna-ladopoulou?in=uclsound/sets/sample-space\nhttps://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/sample-space](https://soundcloud.com/uclsound/sustainability-in-statistical-modelling-of-wind-energy-with-domna-ladopoulou?in=uclsound/sets/sample-space\nhttps://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/sample-space)\n\n:::{.img-left}\n![](IMG_3654.jpg){width=\"65%\"}\n:::\n\nDonna's methodology involves non-parametric probabilistic methods like Gaussian processes and probabilistic neural networks, which offer flexibility and computational efficiency. She emphasizes the importance of informed decision-making in sustainability and the potential for her research to be scaled globally, particularly in regions with high wind power reliance.\n\n![](proposed_methodology.svg){width=\"100%\"}\n\n\n<br><br>\n\n:::: {.author-block}\n::: {style=\"float: left;margin-right: 20px;margin-top: -0px;margin-bottom:0px; object-fit:contain\"}\n![]({{< meta info.pic >}}){width=\"60px\" height=\"60px\" height=\"auto\" width=\"auto\\9\"}\n:::\n# **{{< meta info.author >}}**    \n## {{< meta info.bio >}}\n\n[https://n8thangreen.github.io/](https://n8thangreen.github.io/)\n\n::::\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n<!--\nThis files first derives the relative path to the folder under which the page to share on selected social media is stored. \nThen it creates a series of sharing buttons --- currently implemented:\n- Twitter\n- Email\n- LinkedIn\n- Whatsapp\nOthers are fairly easy to create --- only need the fa icon of the relevant media + the combination of text that would be required\nto automatically share in on that platform\n-->\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n<br>\n<center>\n<!-- This uses a trick and an external widget to share on any of the federated servers on Mastodon\n   see: https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2022/06/create-a-share-to-mastodon-button-for-wordpress/\n-->\n[{{< fa brands mastodon size=lg title=\"Share on Mastodon\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://toot.kytta.dev/?text=Sustainability in Statistical Modelling of Wind Energy - A Podcast https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-04-Sustainability-in-Statistical-Modelling-of-Wind-Energy-A-Podcast){target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,'targetWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=400px,height=600px'); return false;\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands twitter size=lg title=\"Share on Twitter\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-04-Sustainability-in-Statistical-Modelling-of-Wind-Energy-A-Podcast/&text=Sustainability in Statistical Modelling of Wind Energy - A Podcast){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa envelope size=lg title=\"Share by email\" color=\"#383838\">}}](mailto:?subject=Sustainability in Statistical Modelling of Wind Energy - A Podcast&body=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-04-Sustainability-in-Statistical-Modelling-of-Wind-Energy-A-Podcast){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands linkedin size=lg title=\"Share on LinkedIn\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-04-Sustainability-in-Statistical-Modelling-of-Wind-Energy-A-Podcast/&title=Sustainability in Statistical Modelling of Wind Energy - A Podcast){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands whatsapp size=lg title=\"Share on Whatsapp\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=Sustainability in Statistical Modelling of Wind Energy - A Podcasthttps://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-04-Sustainability-in-Statistical-Modelling-of-Wind-Energy-A-Podcast/){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands reddit size=lg title=\"Share on Reddit\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-04-Sustainability-in-Statistical-Modelling-of-Wind-Energy-A-Podcast/&title=Sustainability in Statistical Modelling of Wind Energy - A Podcast){target=\"_blank\"}\n</center>\n\n",
