These controversies raise crucial questions about ethics, data integrity, and the pursuit of truth in academic research. Both Ariely and Gino, known for their groundbreaking studies in human behaviour and decision-making, have faced allegations of data manipulation and misconduct, casting a shadow over their reputations and the field itself.\n\nDan Ariely, a charismatic and unconventional figure in academia, has conducted daring studies throughout his career. However, it's his more recent controversies that have attracted attention. One of his experiments involved administering electric shocks to Craigslist volunteers, falsely claiming they were testing a painkiller. This led to accusations of ethical violations and a one-year suspension from data collection. Additionally, he reportedly offered hush money to a participant to keep the issue quiet. But Ariely's questionable data practices have extended beyond these incidents. Discrepancies in research data and allegations of misrepresenting his studies raised concerns about his commitment to scientific rigour. Critics argue that Ariely prioritised storytelling and publicity over adherence to rigorous scientific standards.\n\nFrancesca Gino, another respected behavioural scientist, has also faced accusations of data manipulation in her studies. While her work has been prolific, questions have also arisen about the authenticity of her results. Ariely and Gino often collaborated on studies related to dishonesty, shedding light on the dark side of human creativity and the counterfeit self. One of their groundbreaking studies involved having participants wear counterfeit designer sunglasses, leading to increased cheating behaviour. Their research exposed how subtle influences could affect human behaviour. These collaborations brought them recognition and fame in the world of behavioural science.\n\nOne study that Gino lead, claimed to have discovered that participants who were asked to sign truthfulness declarations at the top of the page were more honest than those who were asked to sign the declarations at the bottom of the page. However, a 14-page document later compiled by Havard University (where Gino worked) included \"compelling evidence\" of data falsification, including the discovery that someone accessed a database and added and altered data in the file. It was also found that an Excel data spreadsheet related to the study that was sent to co-author Nina Mazar contained metadata that showed that the Excel file was created, and last edited, by a user named Dan Ariely.\n\nThe controversies surrounding Ariely and Gino have ignited discussions about the state of behavioural science as a whole. Some argue that the pressure to produce groundbreaking results and secure funding may tempt researchers to cut corners or sensationalise their findings. The ongoing replication crisis in behavioural science, where many studies fail to reproduce previous results, has only exacerbated these concerns.\n\nIn response to these challenges, there is a growing movement advocating for scientific rigour and transparency in research. The \"credibility revolution\" encourages researchers to prioritise truth over novelty, emphasising incremental progress, curiosity, and adherence to reality instead of sensational findings. This shift aims to reorient the field towards ethical conduct and data integrity.\n\nThe controversies surrounding Dan Ariely and Francesca Gino serve as cautionary tales, reminding the scientific community of the importance of ethics, transparency, and data integrity in research. These cases underscore the need for researchers, institutions, and the broader scientific community to uphold the highest standards of conduct to preserve the credibility of behavioural science. Ultimately, the pursuit of knowledge must always be guided by an unwavering commitment to truth and ethical principles.\n\n## References\n1. https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/25/harvard-professor-data-fraud\n2. https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/09/they-studied-dishonesty-was-their-work-a-lie\n\n<!--\nThis files first derives the relative path to the folder under which the page to share on selected social media is stored. \nThen it creates a series of sharing buttons --- currently implemented:\n- Twitter\n- Email\n- LinkedIn\n- Whatsapp\nOthers are fairly easy to create --- only need the fa icon of the relevant media + the combination of text that would be required\nto automatically share in on that platform\n-->\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n<br>\n<center>\n<!-- This uses a trick and an external widget to share on any of the federated servers on Mastodon\n   see: https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2022/06/create-a-share-to-mastodon-button-for-wordpress/\n-->\n[{{< fa brands mastodon size=lg title=\"Share on Mastodon\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://toot.kytta.dev/?text=Controversies in Academic Research: Ethics, Data Integrity, and Academic Scrutiny https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2023-10-09-controversies-in-academic-research-ethics-data-integrity-and-academic-scrutiny){target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,'targetWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=400px,height=600px'); return false;\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands twitter size=lg title=\"Share on Twitter\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2023-10-09-controversies-in-academic-research-ethics-data-integrity-and-academic-scrutiny/&text=Controversies in Academic Research: Ethics, Data Integrity, and Academic Scrutiny){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa envelope size=lg title=\"Share by email\" color=\"#383838\">}}](mailto:?subject=Controversies in Academic Research: Ethics, Data Integrity, and Academic Scrutiny&body=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2023-10-09-controversies-in-academic-research-ethics-data-integrity-and-academic-scrutiny){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands linkedin size=lg title=\"Share on LinkedIn\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2023-10-09-controversies-in-academic-research-ethics-data-integrity-and-academic-scrutiny/&title=Controversies in Academic Research: Ethics, Data Integrity, and Academic Scrutiny){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands whatsapp size=lg title=\"Share on Whatsapp\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=Controversies in Academic Research: Ethics, Data Integrity, and Academic Scrutinyhttps://sample-space.org/posts/features/2023-10-09-controversies-in-academic-research-ethics-data-integrity-and-academic-scrutiny/){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands reddit size=lg title=\"Share on Reddit\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2023-10-09-controversies-in-academic-research-ethics-data-integrity-and-academic-scrutiny/&title=Controversies in Academic Research: Ethics, Data Integrity, and Academic Scrutiny){target=\"_blank\"}\n</center>\n\n",
