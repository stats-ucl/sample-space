A list of his publications and an obituary by his friend and colleague at UCL  Rex Galbraith can be seen [here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/sites/statistics/files/meryvn-stone-obituary.pdf). After retirement, Stone was actively concerned about 'the misuse of statistics in NHS funding formulae and the unwarranted claims made about them' (Galbraith), and he talks about this in a 2010 interview with him published in *Significance* available [here](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2010.00410.x). Among his many contributions to UCL,  Galbraith mentions that when the  Department of Statistics, then Department of Statistics and Computer Science, was restructured in 1979 following a split resulting in the Department of Computing Science and the Department of Statistical Science, the latter name was chosen by Stone, then Head of Department.\"\n\nimage: \"MS.jpg\" \ninfo:\n  author: \"Mario Cortina Borja\"\n  pic: \"MCB.jpeg\"\n  bio: \"Mario Cortina Borja has been at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health since October 2000; he was appointed Professor of Biostatistics in the Population, Policy and Practice Programme in 2015. Mario has a BSc in Actuarial Science and an MSc in Statistics from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, and a PhD in Statistics from the School of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Bath for a thesis entitled Graph-theoretic nonparametric multivariate procedures.\n\nBefore coming to UCL Mario was a statistician at the Instituto de Investigaciones Antropológicas at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, a research officer in applied mathematics at the Schoolof Chemical Engineering in the University of Bath, a lecturer, then senior lecturer, in Statistics at the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México, and, for five years, consulting and teaching officer in the Department of Statistics, University of Oxford.\"\n  website: \"https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/8365-mario-cortina-borja\"\n---\n\n\n\nMany of Stone's publications are remarkable for their deep impact in theoretical and applied statistics, and more recently in science in general, and data science in particular. I would like to comment on his pioneer paper [Stone M (1974) Cross--Validatory Choice and Assessment of Statistical Predictions. *JRSS-B*, **36**: 111-147](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2984809.pdf?refreqid=fastly-default%3A6cad62e94f9bf73bc0265d3649621bb1&ab_segments=&initiator=&acceptTC=1) (referred hereafter as S74) which was a discussion paper read in the RSS on December 1973 and published a little more than half a century ago, in January 1974.  There were 13 discussants and their questions and Stone's replies are of very high quality.    \n\nS74 formalises cross-validation (CV) methods; in particular, the leave-one-out cross validation procedure is firstly defined there.  The paper also deals with generalising estimates of prediction errors. The paper starts with an erudite Introduction providing the historical context in which CV developed. Stone refers to his preference of the concept of *assessment* of statistical predictions as opposed to *validation*, which 'has a ring of excessive confidence around it', a semantic distinction which should be borne in mind but seldom is. Besides the originality of the ideas defined and developed the paper has a didactic style. In section 2 there are numerous theoretical examples further to general statements. This is followed by a section looking at well-known statistical problems, e.g.  predicting the location of a single univariate sample, predictors for the the *k*-group problem, and the choice of variables for least-squares prediction in which a 'cross-validatory assessment measure' is defined. These examples are defined and analysed in detail through the lens of the methods outlined in the previous section and are then applied to real data. The last section discusses the relation of previous work on CV to  the paper's methods, presents a portrait of \"a conventional paradigm for a large portion of statistical activity including a deviation to consider how the Bayesian paradigm might be accomodated in this scheme, and concudes with a series of quotations addressing philosophical and practical statistical issues.  \n\nThere is no substitute to reading the paper to realise its elegance and usefulness but a quick way to demonstrate its growing importance over 50+ years is to look at its number of citations and the journals in which papers citing S74 have been published. I looked at data on such papers obtained from Web of Science (WoS), which claims to be \"the world's most trusted publisher-independent global citation database\"; citations figures were downloaded on 2nd November 2024 and are shown against year of publication in Figure 1. Note that the last point in the Figure does not refer to the definite number of citations for 2024. Table 1 shows the journals with the largest number of papers citing S74. There is a clear shift from S74 being cited in the statistical methods literature to specialised scientific publications, notably in chemometrics, and more recently to being referenced in general science journals. This process is similar to the three principles of translational medicine: benchside, bedside, and community. This arc from basic science to generalised scientific practice has been experienced by other important statistical papers, notably by David Cox's 1972 paper on the [proportional hazards model](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2517-6161.1972.tb00899.x) whose remarkable trend in number of citations can be\nseen [here](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1740-9713.01634).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<style type=\"text/css\">\nfigcaption {\n  margin: auto;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n</style>\n:::\n\n\n\n:::{.img-left}\n![Figure 1](S74_Citations.png){width=\"75%\"}\n:::\n\n:::{.img-left}\n![Table 1](S74_Table.png){width=\"75%\"}\n:::\n\nMervyn Stone played an important role in UCL, and his contributions to the theory and application of statistical methods continue to be increasingly useful in many scientific areas.
