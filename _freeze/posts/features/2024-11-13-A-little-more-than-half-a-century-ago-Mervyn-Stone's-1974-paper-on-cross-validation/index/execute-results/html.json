A list of his publications and an obituary by his friend and colleague at UCL  Rex Galbraith can be seen [here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/sites/statistics/files/meryvn-stone-obituary.pdf). After retirement, Stone was actively concerned about 'the misuse of statistics in NHS funding formulae and the unwarranted claims made about them' (Galbraith), and he talks about this in a 2010 interview with him published in *Significance* available [here](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2010.00410.x). Among his many contributions to UCL,  Galbraith mentions that when the  Department of Statistics, then Department of Statistics and Computer Science, was restructured in 1979 following a split resulting in the Department of Computing Science and the Department of Statistical Science, the latter name was chosen by Stone, then Head of Department.\"\n\nimage: \"MS.jpg\" \ninfo:\n  author: \"Mario Cortina Borja\"\n  pic: \"MCB.jpeg\"\n  bio: \"Mario Cortina Borja has been at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health since October 2000; he was appointed Professor of Biostatistics in the Population, Policy and Practice Programme in 2015. Mario has a BSc in Actuarial Science and an MSc in Statistics from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, and a PhD in Statistics from the School of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Bath for a thesis entitled Graph-theoretic nonparametric multivariate procedures.\n\nBefore coming to UCL Mario was a statistician at the Instituto de Investigaciones Antropológicas at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, a research officer in applied mathematics at the Schoolof Chemical Engineering in the University of Bath, a lecturer, then senior lecturer, in Statistics at the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México, and, for five years, consulting and teaching officer in the Department of Statistics, University of Oxford.\"\n  website: \"https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/8365-mario-cortina-borja\"\n---\n\n\nOur Head of Department has written a statement in support of this initiative:\n\n\"This is an extremely timely proposal to challenge the legacy of eugenics, as there are benefits of a changing societal perspective to give this work credibility and power that previously was not possible to have. \n\nIt is important that these challenges come from our Statistical Science department specifically, because it was here that eugenics was developed originally. In addition, in conversation with colleagues at other UK institutions, it appears that the whole statistical community does not have a full grasp of our discipline’s role in this particular context. The legacy is still intertwined with much of the subject as it is taught today and many aspects of new technology connected to the subject also have added eugenics baggage. Key examples are represented by problems associated with discrimination bias in human data processing, e.g. in \"frisk-and-search\" policies, or facial/imaging reconstruction.\n\nStudent-led activities to bring about changes to the eugenics legacy are the most empowering. In my view, Stephanie’s proposal has certainly the potential to help the students effectively become the teachers and thus learn while they are in fact leading in the process. \n\nWith this continuation project, which is one of the departmental strategic priorities, within our EDI activities, the brief given to students will be to create an Online Open Access Course about eugenics. A facilitator will act as a support, but the content is designed by students. The course will be available long term and will be a lasting change outcome of the ChangeMakers process. \nThe course will provide wide outreach. The output will be publicly available, contributing to the wider understanding of the underlying phenomenon.\n\nGianluca Baio, Professor of Statistics and Health Economics\"\n\nIf you are a student in the Statistical Science department and you want to get involved, please sign up [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/V668DTK): \n\nIf you are interested but do not want the commitment of regularly attending workshops, please be aware that we will be running a half way feedback event during Term 2 which will be a very social and fun event with cake, where we will invite (anonymous, via Menti) feedback from Statistical Science students and staff about the course development progress.\n\n\n<br><br>\n\n:::: {.author-block}\n::: {style=\"float: left;margin-right: 20px;margin-top: -0px;margin-bottom:0px; object-fit:contain\"}\n![]({{< meta info.pic >}}){width=\"60px\" height=\"60px\" height=\"auto\" width=\"auto\\9\"}\n:::\n# **{{< meta info.author >}}**    \n## {{< meta info.bio >}}\n\n[https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/8365-mario-cortina-borja](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/8365-mario-cortina-borja)\n\n::::\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n<!--\nThis files first derives the relative path to the folder under which the page to share on selected social media is stored. \nThen it creates a series of sharing buttons --- currently implemented:\n- Twitter\n- Email\n- LinkedIn\n- Whatsapp\nOthers are fairly easy to create --- only need the fa icon of the relevant media + the combination of text that would be required\nto automatically share in on that platform\n-->\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n<br>\n<center>\n<!-- This uses a trick and an external widget to share on any of the federated servers on Mastodon\n   see: https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2022/06/create-a-share-to-mastodon-button-for-wordpress/\n-->\n[{{< fa brands mastodon size=lg title=\"Share on Mastodon\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://toot.kytta.dev/?text=A little more than half a century ago: Mervyn Stone's 1974 paper on cross validation https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-11-13-A-little-more-than-half-a-century-ago-Mervyn-Stone's-1974-paper-on-cross-validation){target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,'targetWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=400px,height=600px'); return false;\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands twitter size=lg title=\"Share on Twitter\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-11-13-A-little-more-than-half-a-century-ago-Mervyn-Stone's-1974-paper-on-cross-validation/&text=A little more than half a century ago: Mervyn Stone's 1974 paper on cross validation){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa envelope size=lg title=\"Share by email\" color=\"#383838\">}}](mailto:?subject=A little more than half a century ago: Mervyn Stone's 1974 paper on cross validation&body=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-11-13-A-little-more-than-half-a-century-ago-Mervyn-Stone's-1974-paper-on-cross-validation){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands linkedin size=lg title=\"Share on LinkedIn\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-11-13-A-little-more-than-half-a-century-ago-Mervyn-Stone's-1974-paper-on-cross-validation/&title=A little more than half a century ago: Mervyn Stone's 1974 paper on cross validation){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands whatsapp size=lg title=\"Share on Whatsapp\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=A little more than half a century ago: Mervyn Stone's 1974 paper on cross validationhttps://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-11-13-A-little-more-than-half-a-century-ago-Mervyn-Stone's-1974-paper-on-cross-validation/){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands reddit size=lg title=\"Share on Reddit\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-11-13-A-little-more-than-half-a-century-ago-Mervyn-Stone's-1974-paper-on-cross-validation/&title=A little more than half a century ago: Mervyn Stone's 1974 paper on cross validation){target=\"_blank\"}\n</center>\n\n",
