Before that, I was a postdoc at the University of Oxford working with Prof Chris Holmes and Prof Gil McVean in a joint position between the Big Data Institute and the Department of Statistics.\n\nMy research interests lie predominantly in Bayesian statistics, especially for biomedical applications. I'm interested in using statistics to better understand, and ultimately reduce, health inequalities. I'm one of the co-organisers of the Data Science for Health Equity community (https://www.dsxhe.com) which aims to bring together similarly-minded folk.\n\nOutside of work, I love running - I am particularly obsessed with parkrun.\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n\n<!--another empty column-->\n\n:::\n\n::::\n",
