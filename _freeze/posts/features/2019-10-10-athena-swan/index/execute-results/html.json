The department’s equality and diversity committee, chaired by Alex Donov and Niloufar Abourashchi, meets regularly and works to ensure that the principles of the charter are upheld.*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](NewsletterPhoto_DThomassen_1.jpg){fig-alt='A bunch of people in the department posing in three rows on steps.

However, from the PhD level onwards, there is an imbalance: the proportion of male students is larger. \n\nTo find out more about this imbalance, surveys were conducted among groups of students in the department. I was responsible for the processing and analysis of a survey conducted among a cohort of MSc students at the end of their course. The main tasks were filing the paper survey answers into an electronic data set and analysing this data set. The analysis mainly consisted of trying out different techniques to visualise the data as clearly as possible. In the next Athena SWAN meeting, I will present the results from this analysis.\n\nSo far, I have really enjoyed working on the project. It feels as if the work is appreciated and I was given real responsibility, which is very motivating. I have learned a lot in the process, partly because of useful feedback on my work and partly because it was a nice challenge to rise to. I hope to contribute some ideas based on the data in the upcoming months.\n\n\n**Look out for Doranne’s results in a future edition of Sample Space.** \n",
