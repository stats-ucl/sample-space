This took place at the London Mathematical Society, and was co-organised by our departments' [CSML research theme](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/computational-statistics-and-machine-learning), the [UCL Centre for Data Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/data-science/), and the [UCL ELLIS unit](https://ellis.eu/units/london-ucl), with the organisation led by [Dr. François-Xavier Briol](https://fxbriol.github.io/) and [Dr. Kayvan Sadeghi](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucakksa/).\nimage: \"A7AA7E1D-1201-417E-A018-7F7167C9112D_1_201_a.jpeg\" \ninfo:\n  author: \"Francois-Xavier Briol\"\n  pic: fxbriol_website_photo2.jpg\n  bio: |\n     François-Xavier Briol is an Associate Professor in the Department of Statistical Science at University College London, where he is theme lead for ‘Computational Statistics and Machine Learning’ and co-director of the UCL ELLIS Unit.\n  website: https://fxbriol.github.io\n---\n\n\nThe aim of the event was to increase interactions between researchers working on CSML across all departments at UCL. It included a broad range of talks highlighting exciting methodological advances in MCMC, simulation-based inference and robust optimisation, but also applications of CSML methods in genetics, cosmology, and medical imaging. \n\nSpeakers included [Harita Dellaporta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=avnp0ZsAAAAJ&hl=en) (soon-to-be UCL Statistical Science), [Jason McEwen](http://www.jasonmcewen.org/) (UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory), [Ziheng Yang](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/) (UCL Genetics, Evolution and Environment), [Niall Jeffrey](https://nialljeffrey.github.io/) (UCL Physics & Astronomy), [Marta Betcke](https://sites.google.com/site/mbetcke/) (UCL Computer Science), and [Sam Livingstone](https://samueljlivingstone.wixsite.com/webpage) (UCL Statistical Science).\n\n:::{.img-center}\n![](combinedPics.jpg){width=\"95%\"}\n:::\n\n<br><br>\n\n:::: {.author-block}\n::: {style=\"float: left;margin-right: 20px;margin-top: -0px;margin-bottom:0px; object-fit:contain\"}\n![]({{< meta info.pic >}}){width=\"60px\" height=\"60px\" height=\"auto\" width=\"auto\\9\"}\n:::\n# **{{< meta info.author >}}**    \n## {{< meta info.bio >}}\n\n[https://fxbriol.github.io](https://fxbriol.github.io)\n\n::::\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n<!--\nThis files first derives the relative path to the folder under which the page to share on selected social media is stored. \nThen it creates a series of sharing buttons --- currently implemented:\n- Twitter\n- Email\n- LinkedIn\n- Whatsapp\nOthers are fairly easy to create --- only need the fa icon of the relevant media + the combination of text that would be required\nto automatically share in on that platform\n-->\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n<br>\n<center>\n<!-- This uses a trick and an external widget to share on any of the federated servers on Mastodon\n   see: https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2022/06/create-a-share-to-mastodon-button-for-wordpress/\n-->\n\n[{{< fa brands mastodon size=lg title=\"Share on Mastodon\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://toot.kytta.dev/?text=Event on Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) in the Sciences https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-12-11-CSML-event){target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,'targetWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=400px,height=600px'); return false;\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands twitter size=lg title=\"Share on Twitter\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-12-11-CSML-event/&text=Event on Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) in the Sciences){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa envelope size=lg title=\"Share by email\" color=\"#383838\">}}](mailto:?subject=Event on Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) in the Sciences&body=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-12-11-CSML-event){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands linkedin size=lg title=\"Share on LinkedIn\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-12-11-CSML-event/&title=Event on Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) in the Sciences){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands whatsapp size=lg title=\"Share on Whatsapp\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=Event on Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) in the Scienceshttps://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-12-11-CSML-event/){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands reddit size=lg title=\"Share on Reddit\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-12-11-CSML-event/&title=Event on Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) in the Sciences){target=\"_blank\"}\n</center>\n\n",
