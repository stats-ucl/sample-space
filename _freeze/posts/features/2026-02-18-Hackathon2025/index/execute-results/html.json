There were 6 teams who spent the day creating a website demonstrating the impact of climate change through meaningful statistics and visualisation using real data. There were 3 winning teams, and all winning participants received a fancy raspberry pie full kit for each member of each of the teams.*\n---\n\n\n\n:::{.img-right}\n![](PXL_4.jpg){width=\"50%\"}\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n# The event\nThe UCL Data Science and AI Hackathon 2025 was held on 5th November 2025 and was open to \nfinal year undergraduates and MSc students from the UCL Department of Statistical Science. \nThere were 22 participants, divided into 6 teams in total. \n\n\n# The challenge\n\nThe brief for the challenge was the following: \n\n  * A climate crisis campaigning organisation called Z Climate Change is revamping their website. \n  * They need an impactful demonstration of climate change based on real data.\n  * They like the idea of using statistics and/or machine learning to show the impact. \n  * Your company is bidding for the work to create this website. \n  * Prepare your bid presentation and deliver it. \n\nThe Client (Z Climate Change) has already provided a proof of concept demo using AI, \nwhich was provided to the Hackathon participants. This was created by asking ChatGPT to:\n\n<!-- shown in https://github.com/james-shepherd/UCL-hackathon-2025. -->\n\n* Use data from the [Open Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/).\n* Use an ARIMA model.\n* Predict the next year's max temperature.\n* Show the data and prediction in a graph.\n* Do all of this in HTML and JavaScript.\n\nYour task is to create something better!\n\n<!-- https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/climate-api?end_date=2024-12-31-->\n\n\n# The winners\nThe teams worked tirelessly throughout the day under the guidance of Prof Cotar and Dr Shepherd, combining their knowledge of data analysis, data visualiation, statistical modelling, machine learning and programming. They also learnt plenty of HTML and JavaScript along the way! \nThere were three winning teams, and all winning participants received a fancy raspberry pie full kit for each member of each of the teams:\n\nWinning team: Data4Earth \nSecond place: Shamrocks \nThird Place: Climate Cleaners\n\n\n:::{.img}\n![](PXL_1.jpg){width=\"70%\"}\n:::\n\n:::{.img}\n![](PXL_6.jpg){width=\"70%\"}\n:::\n\n\n# About PA Consulting\n\n[PA Consulting](https://www.paconsulting.com/) include 4,000 experts working from\noffices across the UK, US, Netherlands and Nordics.\nThey have 18 Offices across 17 cities and 3 regions.\n\nTheir capabilities span a wide\nrange of technical areas across seven sectors: \n\n* Consumer and Manufacturing\n* Government and Public Services\n* Defence and Security\n* Health and Life Sciences\n* Energy and Utilities\n* Transport\n* Financial Services\n\n<!-- PA's diverse teams of experts – strategists, innovators,\ndesigners, consultants, digital experts, scientists, engineers,\nand technologists – accelerate new growth innovations from\nconcept, through design, development and to commercial\nsuccess.
