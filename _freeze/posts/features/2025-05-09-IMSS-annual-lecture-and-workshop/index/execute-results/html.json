Our keynote speaker is [Thordis Thorarinsdottir](https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/people/aca/thordist/index.html) from the University of Oslo, and we have three other talks lined up from [Henry Moss](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/research/mars/people/henry-moss2) (Lancaster), [Laura Mansfield](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/mansfield) (Oxford) and [James Salter](https://experts.exeter.ac.uk/26439-james-salter/publications) (Exeter).*\n   \nimage: \"thordisthorarinsdottir.jpeg\" \ninfo:\n\n---\n\n\n\n:::{.img-right}\n![](thordisthorarinsdottir.jpeg){width=\"30%\"}\n:::\n\nThe theme of the symposium is \"Some statistical contributions in climate research\", and our keynote speaker Thordis (pictured) is going to talk about uncertainty quantification and model evaluation for climate research. It’s a really interesting topic which is full of fascinating statistical challenges, so promises to be a very stimulating event.\n\nAlthough Thordis’ keynote will focus on climate research, she’s also giving a training workshop on probabilistic forecast evaluation on Monday 9th June. Research students in particular are strongly encouraged to attend this (and, of course, the symposium on 10th!). It’s free for UCL delegates.\n\nFull details of these events, including registration links, can be found [here for the symposium](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-statistical-sciences/events/2025/jun/some-statistical-contributions-climate-research-imss-annual-lecture) on 10th June and [here for the training workshop](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-statistical-sciences/events/2025/jun/imss-annual-lecture-workshop-evaluating-forecasts-and-training-forecast-models) on 9th. I hope that as many of you as possible will be able to join us.\n\n\n<!--\nThis files first derives the relative path to the folder under which the page to share on selected social media is stored. \nThen it creates a series of sharing buttons --- currently implemented:\n- Twitter\n- Email\n- LinkedIn\n- Whatsapp\nOthers are fairly easy to create --- only need the fa icon of the relevant media + the combination of text that would be required\nto automatically share in on that platform\n-->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n<center>\n<!-- This uses a trick and an external widget to share on any of the federated servers on Mastodon\n   see: https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2022/06/create-a-share-to-mastodon-button-for-wordpress/\n-->\n\n[{{< fa brands mastodon size=lg title=\"Share on Mastodon\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://toot.kytta.dev/?text=IMSS annual lecture and workshop https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2025-05-09-IMSS-annual-lecture-and-workshop){target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,'targetWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=400px,height=600px'); return false;\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands twitter size=lg title=\"Share on Twitter\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2025-05-09-IMSS-annual-lecture-and-workshop/&text=IMSS annual lecture and workshop){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa envelope size=lg title=\"Share by email\" color=\"#383838\">}}](mailto:?subject=IMSS annual lecture and workshop&body=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2025-05-09-IMSS-annual-lecture-and-workshop){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands linkedin size=lg title=\"Share on LinkedIn\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2025-05-09-IMSS-annual-lecture-and-workshop/&title=IMSS annual lecture and workshop){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands whatsapp size=lg title=\"Share on Whatsapp\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=IMSS annual lecture and workshophttps://sample-space.org/posts/features/2025-05-09-IMSS-annual-lecture-and-workshop/){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands reddit size=lg title=\"Share on Reddit\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2025-05-09-IMSS-annual-lecture-and-workshop/&title=IMSS annual lecture and workshop){target=\"_blank\"}\n</center>\n\n",
