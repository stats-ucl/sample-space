It was held from 12th July to 16th July in Montréal, Canada this year. ISMB 2024 featured 17 specialised tracks, encompassing a broad spectrum of topics within computational biology and bioinformatics, including sequence analysis, systems biology, molecular dynamics, computational and systems immunology, digital agriculture, …etc. The conference also offered a variety of workshops, tutorials, and keynote sessions, making it a comprehensive forum that appeals to professionals across the field.\"\nimage: \"ISMB.jpg\" \ninfo:\n  author: \"Shanshan Ren\"\n  pic: \"unnamed.jpg\"\n  bio: \"Shanshan is interested in biostatistics, computational statistics, and Bayesian statistics. Her work involves developing, adapting, and applying computational-statistical methodology to model cutting-edge genomic data.\"\n  website:\n---\n\n\n:::{.img-right}\n![](ISMB.jpg){width=\"40%\"}\n:::\n\nThe conference also hosted several social events designed to facilitate networking among participants. Among these, the event titled \"Women in Computational Biology\" left a particularly strong impression on me. Unlike the more conventional dinner events, this event offered a more relaxed atmosphere, guiding attendees on a tour of Montréal. This setting allowed participants to first become acquainted with one another, naturally transitioning into discussions about their research and work as the event progressed.\n\nI was pleased to have my poster presentation scheduled two days after the \"Women in Computational Biology\" event. Engaging with individuals I had met during that event provided valuable insights, revealing that the interests of many conference attendees lean more towards biological aspects rather than mathematical or statistical emphasis. Consequently, I adjusted my presentation to emphasise the biological background and implications of my research, while omitting some of the more detailed statistical theories and equations. This approach not only garnered greater attention but also stimulated more in-depth discussions with the audience.\n\nI gained a wealth of knowledge from this conference, ranging from practical tips—such as including a photo on one’s poster when presenting a poster at big conferences, to facilitating interactions with attendees who may not be able to attend the designated presentation session if they could meet you in the hallway of the conference centre—to significant insights into the latest advancements in my research field, which have provided inspiration for future research directions. Overall, the experience was highly enriching, and I am grateful for the departmental funding that enabled me to attend the  ISMB conference this summer.\n\n<br><br>\n\n:::: {.author-block}\n::: {style=\"float: left;margin-right: 20px;margin-top: -0px;margin-bottom:0px; object-fit:contain\"}\n![]({{< meta info.pic >}}){width=\"60px\" height=\"60px\" height=\"auto\" width=\"auto\\9\"}\n:::\n# **{{< meta info.author >}}**    \n## {{< meta info.bio >}}\n\n\n\n::::\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n<!--\nThis files first derives the relative path to the folder under which the page to share on selected social media is stored. \nThen it creates a series of sharing buttons --- currently implemented:\n- Twitter\n- Email\n- LinkedIn\n- Whatsapp\nOthers are fairly easy to create --- only need the fa icon of the relevant media + the combination of text that would be required\nto automatically share in on that platform\n-->\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n<br>\n<center>\n<!-- This uses a trick and an external widget to share on any of the federated servers on Mastodon\n   see: https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2022/06/create-a-share-to-mastodon-button-for-wordpress/\n-->\n[{{< fa brands mastodon size=lg title=\"Share on Mastodon\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://toot.kytta.dev/?text=A Visit to the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference, Montréal, Canada. https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-05-Intelligent-Systems-for-Molecular-Biology-conference){target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,'targetWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=400px,height=600px'); return false;\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands twitter size=lg title=\"Share on Twitter\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-05-Intelligent-Systems-for-Molecular-Biology-conference/&text=A Visit to the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference, Montréal, Canada.){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa envelope size=lg title=\"Share by email\" color=\"#383838\">}}](mailto:?subject=A Visit to the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference, Montréal, Canada.&body=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-05-Intelligent-Systems-for-Molecular-Biology-conference){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands linkedin size=lg title=\"Share on LinkedIn\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-05-Intelligent-Systems-for-Molecular-Biology-conference/&title=A Visit to the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference, Montréal, Canada.){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands whatsapp size=lg title=\"Share on Whatsapp\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=A Visit to the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference, Montréal, Canada.https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-05-Intelligent-Systems-for-Molecular-Biology-conference/){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands reddit size=lg title=\"Share on Reddit\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-09-05-Intelligent-Systems-for-Molecular-Biology-conference/&title=A Visit to the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference, Montréal, Canada.){target=\"_blank\"}\n</center>\n\n",
