Many of us have been lucky enough to attend and present at international specialist conferences on teaching statistics, including in Argentina, Australia, Canada and Japan. We bring back what we learn from attending these conferences to UCL, including fruitful connections with educators from other institutions.\n\nHeading to international conferences is often impractical. Though we have UK-based conferences such as [Burwalls](https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/burwalls/) (teaching statistics to medical and allied health sciences) and [CETL-MSOR](https://www.sigma-network.ac.uk/cetl-msor/) (teaching maths, stats and operational research), we’re missing a specialist conference on Teaching Statistics in the UK emulating the set-ups in the [US](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots23) and [Australia](https://www.asc2023.org/ozcots). An opportunity for statistics educators to meet and present their research – without having to travel too far (!) – is sorely needed.\n\nThough my day job is very much at UCL, I also chair the Royal Statistical Society’s Teaching Statistics Section. I’m very excited that we are organizing the first [UK Conference on Teaching Statistics](https://www.ukcots.org/),  affectionally known as UKCOTS. Our first conference will be held at The University of Manchester on the 13-14th June 2024.\n\nWe’ve been amazed by the amount of interest that UKCOTS has already generated, in terms of the number of abstracts for presentations we received but also those who have offered their encouragement in putting together the conference. We are lucky to have the support of the [Teaching Statistics journal](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14679639), who will publish a special edition to showcase the best of statistics education research that was presented at the conference.\n\nThere will therefore be an emphasis on statistics education research at the first UKCOTS. The conference programme with include a plenary session that will gather experienced researchers in statistics education, with a variety of other sessions dedicated to developing researchers scheduled throughout the conference.\n\nEveryone is welcome at [UKCOTS](https://www.ukcots.org/), whether you teach statistics to specialist or non-specialist students, whether you’re highly experienced or just starting out, and whether your interest is in teaching in Higher Education, professional training, or statistical literacy in the general population. We hope to see you there in June!\n\n<br><br>\n\n:::: {.author-block}\n::: {style=\"float: left;margin-right: 20px;margin-top: -0px;margin-bottom:0px; object-fit:contain\"}\n![]({{< meta info.pic >}}){width=\"60px\" height=\"60px\" height=\"auto\" width=\"auto\\9\"}\n:::\n# **{{< meta info.author >}}**    \n## {{< meta info.bio >}}\n\n[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/people/elinor-jones](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/people/elinor-jones)\n\n::::\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n<!--\nThis files first derives the relative path to the folder under which the page to share on selected social media is stored. \nThen it creates a series of sharing buttons --- currently implemented:\n- Twitter\n- Email\n- LinkedIn\n- Whatsapp\nOthers are fairly easy to create --- only need the fa icon of the relevant media + the combination of text that would be required\nto automatically share in on that platform\n-->\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n<br>\n<center>\n<!-- This uses a trick and an external widget to share on any of the federated servers on Mastodon\n   see: https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2022/06/create-a-share-to-mastodon-button-for-wordpress/\n-->\n[{{< fa brands mastodon size=lg title=\"Share on Mastodon\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://toot.kytta.dev/?text=UK Conference on Teaching Statistics (UKCOTS) https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-03-08-UK-Conference-on-Teaching-Statistics){target=\"_blank\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href,'targetWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=400px,height=600px'); return false;\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands twitter size=lg title=\"Share on Twitter\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-03-08-UK-Conference-on-Teaching-Statistics/&text=UK Conference on Teaching Statistics (UKCOTS)){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa envelope size=lg title=\"Share by email\" color=\"#383838\">}}](mailto:?subject=UK Conference on Teaching Statistics (UKCOTS)&body=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-03-08-UK-Conference-on-Teaching-Statistics){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands linkedin size=lg title=\"Share on LinkedIn\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-03-08-UK-Conference-on-Teaching-Statistics/&title=UK Conference on Teaching Statistics (UKCOTS)){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands whatsapp size=lg title=\"Share on Whatsapp\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=UK Conference on Teaching Statistics (UKCOTS)https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-03-08-UK-Conference-on-Teaching-Statistics/){target=\"_blank\"} &nbsp;\n[{{< fa brands reddit size=lg title=\"Share on Reddit\" color=\"#383838\" >}}](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://sample-space.org/posts/features/2024-03-08-UK-Conference-on-Teaching-Statistics/&title=UK Conference on Teaching Statistics (UKCOTS)){target=\"_blank\"}\n</center>\n\n",
